Assembling the frame properly is key to building a stable printer, particularly at high speeds. We're going to assemble in sections, squaring as we go. The result will be a very rigid, heavyweight frame.

## Assembly Order

The order of assembly is fairly logical:

1. Assemble the side frames.
2. Add in crossbars and connect the two halves.
3. Install Z axis flooring and use the cut panels to align the frame.
4. Assemble the X/Y frame and install.
5. Align everything/check for fit.

## Perpendicular Joint Steps

1. Loosely attach bracket to both frame pieces.
2. Align corners and tension against square.
3. Lock screw down on one extrusion.
4. Check alignment and positioning.
5. Tighten second screw and position.
6. Confirm perpendicularity one more time.
