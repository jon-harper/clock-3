!!! note
    In this section we will be cutting polyisocyanurate foam (PIR foam, often called "polyiso"). Several tips:

    - PIR foam tears easily, so use a blade with a straight edge.
    - Additionally, the aluminum radiant barrier on one side is very thin and tears easily. You will need a sharp blade to get a clean cut.
    - When in doubt, cut wide and pare down to fit in place later.
    
!!! caution
    - Do not try to make a crease on side and cut the other: the crease that appears on the uncut part of the foam will not align with the precut area. Instead cut halfway, then cut a second or third time more deeply over the first until breaking through.
    - Use a piece of cardboard underneath the foam to avoid cutting anything important underneath the foam and/or damaging your blade.

## Materials

| Parts | Description                              |
|-------|------------------------------------------|
| MN003 | VHB Tape, Double-Sided, 1" Width         |
| MN100 | Polyisocyanurate Foam, 1/2", 4'x8' sheet |

## A. Mark Side Panels

1. Turn the frame on its side.
2. Lay a ~2'/600 wide strip of PIR foam across the side panel
3. Put something slightly heavy on top to keep it pressed down.
4. Draw an outline of the inside of the frame on the insulation. Do this for both halves.
5. Repeat the outline several times to ensure it covers at much area as possible.
6. Set aside on a flat surface and carefully cut the insulation.

## B. Mark Rear Panel

1. Leave the frame on its side.
2. Cut a strip slightly wider than 2'/600mm of PIR foam.
3. Use something heavy to press it firmly against the back of the frame (or push against a wall).
4. Mark an outline of the inside of the frame on the insulation, repeating twice.
5. Set aside on a flat surface and carefully cut the insulation.

## C. Mark Top Panel

1. Cut a 2'/600mm wide strip of PIR foam insulation.
2. Press firmly against the top of the frame.
3. Mark an outline of the frame and brackets, repeating twice.
4. Set aside on a flat surface and carefully cut the insulation.

## D. Floor Cover Insulation

1. Mark two (2) 40mm x 300mm strips of insulation.
2. Mark two (2) 40mm x 140mm strips of insulation.
3. Cut each strip individually.
5. Place a piece of VHB tape on each the 140mm strips.
6. Place a piece of VHB tape on both ends of each of the 300mm strips.
7. Attach to the underside of the floor cover.

## E. Floor Hatch Insulation
