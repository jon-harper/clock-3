Clock 3's' Z axis is essentially symmetrical. There are two Z steppers, each with its own driver and limit switch. The left stepper is Z1, the right is Z2. Making sure those steppers and the linear rails are aligned prevents binding, so we will take some time to ensure both halves are aligned relative to one another during this process.

## Assembly Order

After the bed is assembled, the rest of the assembly process is centered on the linear rails and lead screws:

1. Assemble the bed frame.
2. Install the Z steppers and floor sealing bearing.
3. Install the Z gantries and limit switches.
4. Attach the bed frame and align the linear rails.
5. Lubricate and install the lead screws.

When you're ready, we'll get started.
