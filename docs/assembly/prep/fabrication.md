Before we start making a mess, let's make sure you have a few things and do get a few parts ready.

## 1. Frame

You should have all of the aluminum extrusion pieces listed in the [Framing section](../../bom/bill_of_materials.md#framing) of the BOM. We're going to label the extrusion pieces next, so we recommend keeping them sorted by length and width for now.

## 2. Panels

Before you begin assembly, it's a good idea to have the wood and acrylic panel fabrication completed. Sometimes it can take awhile to find a fabricator, get a quote, and have the work produced. We'll need the floor pieces to help align the Z axis crossbars, and all of the panel pieces are helpful in marking out the insulation cuts.

If you plan to paint/stain and/or seal your panels, bear in mind that any sealant will need to have cured before attaching the insulation with adhesive.

## 3. Door Panel Gaskets

The door panel gaskets (PNs 713 and 714) probably aren't cut to size yet. Keep them handy--we'll cut those shortly.

## 4. Insulation

**TODO**

## 5. Printed Parts

We'll be adding heat set inserts soon, so your printed parts need to be finished before then.

## 6. Wiring

Unless you're having your wiring made or are experienced at wire crimping, we recommend practicing making connectors and watching/reading about crimping wires.

!!! warning
    Poor electrical connections and loose wiring can cause a fire. It's very important that you're able to consistently make good crimps.
