    May we suggest [The Alan Parsons Project](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lNCAUSEhegqjQAMMocw1QFu9G-bE4zeTM)?

There are a lot of tee nuts. Thankfully, this goes quickly with the extrusions labeled. The list below is fairly straightforward: the ID of the extrusion, the number of tee nuts needed, and a picture of roughly where each te`e nut goes. Click or tap the image to zoom in.
    
!!! attention
    - The tee nuts only need to be in the right channel and roughly in the right place. We will position them more precisely later.
    - Orientation only matters when a tee nut is near the edge of an extrusion. When a tee nut is very near the edge, put the roller bearing end in first. See [A3](../../img/tee_nuts/A3.jpg) for an example. Note that the hole is closer to the outer edge.

## Part List

Rather than a table, we'll use a short list:

- Every extrusion
- 275x PN575, Tee Nut, 6mm Slot, M5, Roll In (all of them)

## 4. Door

There's only one slot to insert tee nuts on these extrusions, so they're all in one image.

!!! note
    Z1 and Z2 have a bracket already installed in the photo. For now, just install a tee nut there.
