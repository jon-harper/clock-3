Hello there. Firstly, thanks for reading the Clock 3 Documentation.

## Overview

This page relates to areas of the documentation where feedback is actively soughtâ€”though any feedback is always welcome. It is grouped as a set of questions to answer about the documentation. This can be viewed as a literal list of questions or suggestions as a starting point for reviewing the documentation.

## Terminology

First, let's establish terminology. The links on the left with arrows next to them are "categories". If a link sends you to a page and does not have children (no arrow), it is a "page". These contain actual content. Each page is divided into sections and subsections. On the right is a "Table of Contents". Every page has one, and each Table of Contents will let you jump quickly from section to section.

With that said, we'll start with navigation, which relates to the above.

## Navigation

- Clarity: Without the explanation above about categories/pages and sections/subsections:
    - Is it obvious what page one is on (is it clear on the left that this is the TODO List page)?
    - Is the Table of Contents visible enough as a TOC (font size, color, etc.)?
    - Should there be an area explaining navigation on the Overview page? Conversely, would this be too low-level for a technical audience?
- Links
    - Are there enough in-site links (links from one page to another)?
    - Are external navigation links, such as to guides, clear enough?

## Appearance

- Are the font sizes and styles appropriate?
- Should heading color be adjusted for sections and subsections to help with visual clarity?
- Alternatively, should a divider be used between sections to aid the color blind and/or add visual space?

## Content

- Does each section page have a sufficient introduction, i.e. if arrived at without viewing the previous page, is it clear what the section page contains?
- Should photos or [wireframes projections](img/frame_labels/bed.png) be preferred for directions when either is available?
