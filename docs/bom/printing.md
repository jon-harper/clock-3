## 2. Parts and Quantity

You can find the [STL Files here](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock-3/tree/main/STL). The number of each part to print is specified in the [Bill of Materials](../bom/bill_of_materials.md), along with a direct link.

## 3. Heat Set Inserts

Many of the parts for Clock 3 require heated inserts. Once you see these in action with ABS, a whole world of possibilities opens. We have two suggestions:

1. Get a heat set insert press or make one ([ex. 1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3613621), [ex. 2](https://hackaday.com/2020/09/09/building-an-affordable-press-for-heat-set-inserts/)). It's an investment. Trust us.
2. Practice ahead of time on the [practice block](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock-3/blob/main/STL/Tools/M3%20Heat%20Set%20Insert%20Practice%20Block.stl). It will use a few inserts, but you'll feel more comfortable working on the printed parts.
