# Bill of Materials

The columns of this list are abbreviated for readability and reference. The
[Excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/jon-harper/clock-3/blob/main/BOM/bill_of_materials.xlsx)
version contains additional columns that are helpful in sourcing.

!!! warning
    The script that auto-generates this list does not read decimal values. Anything measured in length
    is measured in centimeters (cm) instead of meters (m) to work around this.
    
!!! note
    - Materials are used in fabricating parts found later in the Bill of Materials or cable
      list. Some parts, particularly the acrylic and wood panels, will likely require outside
      fabrication.
    - All reference URLs and suppliers are purely for assistance in sourcing materials and are
      not endorsed.
    - The "Supplies" category includes a large number of components that are often already in the
      hands of experienced makers. As such, the list is primarily for reference and is not formally
      part of the Bill of Materials.
