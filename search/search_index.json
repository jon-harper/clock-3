Welcome This site acts as a central documentation point for the Clock 3 project. In addition to general information on the project, here you can find help and guides for: Sourcing materials Fabricating parts Assembly Initial configuration This is a large project with one developer, so this documentation will evolve iteratively. Feedback is welcome via the GitHub repository . Bill of Materials This documentation includes a general Sales Bill of Materials to guide purchasing and decision making. This is a list of what you will need to actually purchase or have on hand. Some of the materials will need to be modified, fabricated, or permanently used to make other parts before or during assembly. The list of all parts once the raw materials are consumed and ready for assembly is the Assembly Bill of Materials . Think of the Sales BOM as what you need to buy; the Assembly BOM is what you'll use to build. The Clock 3 repository contains a more detailed version of these files . Assembly We've assembled and then broken down the Clock 3 prototype repeatedly so that you don't have to do the same with yours. Assembly of Clock 3 is meant to be logical, intuitive, and easy: every wire is pre-measured, every heated insert accounted for. It's a time investment to get everything ready, but the result is a very straightforward assembly process. Configuration Clock 3 runs on MainsailOS , which is an all-in-one OS for running Klipper firmware with a clean web frontend. Clock 3 relies on a modified Klipper 12864 menu system and display with more functionality than the stock menu system. We've setup several repositories so that you can simply git clone the configuration files directly onto your Raspberry Pi in the appropriate directories. Outside Guides and Documentation Links At various points during assembly and configuration, guides for certain tasks are already available from the manufacturer, developer, or maintainer (or simply a third party). We will often link to an external guide for more detailed explanations of some procedures. An example of this is in the initial configuration of MainsailOS . The developers of Mainsail will always have more current documentation regarding installation and setup than ours, so we defer to them where needed.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#welcome","text":"This site acts as a central documentation point for the Clock 3 project.

Firstly, thanks for reading the Clock 3 Documentation. Overview This page relates to areas of the documentation where feedback is actively sought\u2014though any feedback is always welcome. It is grouped as a set of questions to answer about the documentation. This can be viewed as a literal list of questions or suggestions as a starting point for reviewing the documentation. Terminology First, let's establish terminology. The links on the left with arrows next to them are \"categories\". If a link sends you to a page and does not have children (no arrow), it is a \"page\". These contain actual content. Each page is divided into sections and subsections. On the right is a \"Table of Contents\". Every page has one, and each Table of Contents will let you jump quickly from section to section. With that said, we'll start with navigation, which relates to the above. Navigation Clarity: Without the explanation above about categories/pages and sections/subsections: Is it obvious what page one is on (is it clear on the left that this is the TODO List page)? Is the Table of Contents visible enough as a TOC (font size, color, etc.)? Should there be an area explaining navigation on the Overview page? Conversely, would this be too low-level for a technical audience? Links Are there enough in-site links (links from one page to another)? Are external navigation links, such as to guides, clear enough? Appearance Are the font sizes and styles appropriate? Should heading color be adjusted for sections and subsections to help with visual clarity? Alternatively, should a divider be used between sections to aid the color blind and/or add visual space? Content Does each section page have a sufficient introduction, i.e. if arrived at without viewing the previous page, is it clear what the section page contains? Should photos or wireframes projections be preferred for directions when either is available?","title":"Editing/Reviewing/TODO"},{"location":"todo/#overview","text":"This page relates to areas of the documentation where feedback is actively sought\u2014though any feedback is always welcome.

General Questions Why another 3D printer? Note TODO This is a longer story that I'd like to get right. Can I get a kit from somewhere? That would be super cool, but not at the moment. Can you build one for me? No, but a Bill of Materials is in the final stages of verification and formatting. In addition, documentation on the assembly and configuration process is ongoing. Will you come work for my company? Hey, that's a cool idea. Here's my LinkedIn . Reach out and we'll find out. Conceptual Why so many lock washers? A bag of 500 lock washers costs not much more than 100. A builder will need more than 100 lock washers no matter what I do, so I standardized on M5 screw + lock washer + tee nut where it is reasonable to do so. Also, Loctite eats ABS if it's not completely dry, and there's a lot of it in this printer. Why a V6 hotend instead of [x]? Several reasons: V6 clones are readily available and generally only differ in length with respect to compatibility the mount interface can be reused for other hotends that are \"groove mount\" style, like the newer Dragon hotends. Why does the Z axis not have a third driver? That's on the todo list for the future. Given time and cost constraints, two steppers has to do for now. With silicone columns and a BLTouch for assisted leveling, it's less a problem than a \"nice to have\". I have studied the RatRig design and find their three-point leveling design exceptional. Future iterations of this project may adapt a similar bearing-style magnetic mount. Why not a larger build volume? I strongly considered this, but settled on the Creality CR-10 form factor. Going larger starts becoming quite troublesome: Overall increase in cost beyond 310x310mm Power usage scales nonlinearly, as bed volume scales quadratically and chamber volume cubically. CR-10 build plates are cheap and readily available. 350mm build plates (and larger) are harder to come by. A 300mm^2 build plate can still reasonably be heated with a built-in DC heater. Larger areas require AC pads, which means adding a relay, a cutoff, more wiring...and more risk if mis-installed. The Z volume is limited somewhat by the stepper being placed outside of the chamber. This necessarily sacrifices about 150mm of thread, and a 500mm lead screw is already hard enough to get aligned. However , MIC-6 aluminum build plates are plentiful enough now that a future revision of this project will likely switch over to using one. Why don't you use M4 screws? To keep the number and type of screws down. This project is made entirely of M3 and M5 screws with the exception of the bed and PSU, which both require M4 fasteners for mounting. Materials and Sourcing Do I have to use the same brands for materials (e.g. Misumi)? Most of the printer is substitutable with OEM materials. Although initial support is only provided for the BIGTREETECH Octopus MCU, a FYSETC S6 or Spider would theoretically work just as well. The only part that can't be substituted without major work is the Raspberry Pi. There is a really good supplier that sells custom [x]. Why don't you use their product? I'm avoiding single-source parts (Raspberry Pi and MISUMI door frame notwithstanding). Ideally this will keep costs down as well as prevent supply and sourcing issues. Can I use Neopixels (WS2812B, 5V) instead of WS2815 (12V)? Yes. You can even use a different driver, like APA102, as long as it uses no more than 4 wires (VCC, GND, and one or two data). The SP901E is a data repeater and compatible across a range of voltages. That said, you may see a small difference in lighting quality with a 5V LED string like the Neopixel due to voltage drop across 2 meters of wire.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"about/faq/#general-questions","text":"","title":"General Questions"},{"location":"about/faq/#why-another-3d-printer","text":"Note TODO This is a longer story that I'd like to get right.","title":"Why another 3D printer?"},{"location":"about/faq/#can-i-get-a-kit-from-somewhere","text":"That would be super cool, but not at the moment.","title":"Can I get a kit from somewhere?"},{"location":"about/faq/#can-you-build-one-for-me","text":"No, but a Bill of Materials is in the final stages of verification and formatting.

Ease of Sourcing Use off-the-shelf components where possible. 400mm linear rails and 500mm lead screws were chosen for ready availability. JST-SM connectors are used for all intermediate, low-amperage connections. Limit switches are the Makerbot/Creality style. Heated bed is a stock replacement Creality CR-10 bed (310x310mm). Heater cartridges are tailed with Micro Fit 3.0 connectors, which are used on E3D V6-compatible cartridges. Minimize the number of fastener types. Fasteners are (with minimal exception) M3 button head or M5 socket head cap screws. Minor exceptions are all readily available and small in number. Care is taken to avoid adding new fastener lengths or types unless necessary. Custom-fabricated components are few and easily sourced. Panels have as few cutouts are possible and are easily laser-cut. Vector paths for laser cuts are provided. Floor panels have gaps with filled by printed cutouts for wiring passthrough. Wiring is instead connected to a printed panel mount underneath the flooring. Frame relies on perpendicular braces, largely avoiding tapped ends. Blind joints or counterbored and tapped holes are completely unused. Ease of Access, Service, and Modification Design for ease of assembly and simple cable management. Parts have printed ID numbers to help identification. Left- and right-handed parts are notated with a printed 'L' or 'R', as well. Many printed components have zip tie anchors and cable guides. Components are made to be serviceable and accessible. Disassembly of most components does not require other components to be disassembled first. A gantry lock design is included to keep the gantry in place and square when working on belts. Side and rear panels unscrew and take the insulation with them. Components and cabling are almost entirely separated, i.e. electrical components can be unplugged from a harness. Easy, direct access to electronics through two individually-removeable floor panels. Side panels use drop-in tee nuts for quick removal and reattachment. Flexibility, Safety, and Stability Design parametrically to allow for flexible build parameters. The core Fusion 360 file can be adjusted for different print tolerances. Build volume can be scaled up (capability is maintained, but this is not actively developed yet). Different types and depths of heated inserts can be used; likewise, adjustments can be made for different print tolerances. NOTE: The pace of development occured technical debt in this area. V0.8/v0.9 (after completed documentation) will involve a significant rework of the Fusion 360 model. Build in air filtration and ambient temperature control. Dual fans for recirculated and vented air, fed through both activated carbon and HEPA. Filtration system is in steady production use. Heavy use of insulation allows for high chamber temperatures with only air exhaust for cooling. Document everything.

Assembly involves a large number of individual parts. We'll do our best to divide the process up into manageable chunks. For the purposes of this guide, instructions are for an unmodified version of the Clock 3 prototype. Warning We will be working with electricity and carefully positioning parts. Patience and caution are needed. Rushing any part of assembly now can cause issues later or even be hazardous . Take your time, take breaks, and double-check your work! A Guided Tour Below are the stages of the assembly process. Bear in mind that not all steps take the same amount of time. Preparation This stage is much like setting up a construction site. We need to figure out where to put our tools and supplies. Check that we have all of the supplies we need. Do some early work and prepare for the rest of the assembly. Framing Building Blocks The first step is the frame. We'll assemble it in several pieces and check for a square, rigid assembly. Kinematics This is a four step process. Essentially, we start with the Z steppers and build up and in towards the X gantry. Lastly, we fasten the belts. Z Axis XY Axes X Gantry Belts Electronics, Part 1 At this point, we'll have much of the topside of the printer done. Before we wire anything, everything that needs a connector should be in place. This is where we unbox the control board, hotend, and install the rest of the steppers. Wiring Here we'll start measuring out wires, cutting them to roughly the right length, and generally getting ready to make a lot of cabling. Electronics, Part 2 At this point, it's time to make connectors and actually run our finished cabling. We start from the MCU and work our way up. Finishing Up and Closing Up The is the last of the hardware setup, where we install the door, side panels, and air filtration. We'll check for a solid seal in the chamber and resolve any issues. Conventions Like with the categorization of parts in the Bill of Materials, there are other conventions we use during the assembly process to identify parts and orient them quickly. We will introduce them as we go through the Preparation section of this Guide. TODO (Any other necessary background) Okay, let's check and make sure we have what we need.","title":"Assembly Guide Introduction"},{"location":"assembly/#a-guided-tour","text":"Below are the stages of the assembly process.

Note In this section we will be cutting polyisocyanurate foam (PIR foam, often called \"polyiso\"). Several tips: PIR foam tears easily, so use a blade with a straight edge. Additionally, the aluminum radiant barrier on one side is very thin and tears easily. You will need a sharp blade to get a clean cut. When in doubt, cut wide and pare down to fit in place later. Caution Do not try to make a crease on side and cut the other: the crease that appears on the uncut part of the foam will not align with the precut area. Instead cut halfway, then cut a second or third time more deeply over the first until breaking through. Use a piece of cardboard underneath the foam to avoid cutting anything important underneath the foam and/or damaging your blade.

The information here will both help you understand the rest of the guide and offer a few tips, as well. 1. Frame Pieces Pieces of frame of the same length have part numbers, but individual pieces also have an ID. These help locate where on the frame a piece goes and when inserting roll-in tee nuts. It's important to label each piece so that once we start inserting tee nuts, we don't get the pieces confused. To preserve our own sanity during development, we started labeling frame pieces in the same place, using the FTL rule: F ront T op L eft Every frame piece is labeled with its ID in the front, top left corner of where it belongs on the printer . If the front is a cut face on the extrusion, we put a label on the top, in the front left corner instead. This is a consistent strategy we use throughout this assembly guide. Here's an example of a labeled part and how the FTL scheme works in practice. This picture is of frame piece A1 , which is stickered in the upper left. With this as a reference, we can show each face of the extrusion and where the tee nuts belong. We will label each piece before we get started assembling the frame. For the moment, keep them organized by length/part number. 2. Printed Part Numbers Most printed parts have their part number embossed somewhere. Once installed the number won't be visible--they are solely there to help you find the part you are looking for. Anything without a part number is labeled in the notes column of the Bill of Materials. We recommend putting these unnumbered parts in bags and labeling them. Note Parts are also labeled with an 'L' or 'R' if there are two parts that are mirrors. 3. The Later Area There are some things you won't need until near the very end of assembly. We can set these parts in \"Later Area\" to keep what you don't need immediately stored. Here's the list: ID Description PN9XX The entire Electrical section of the BOM. PN8XX The entire Misc. section of the BOM. PN797 Foam Weatherstripping PN4XX The entire Toolhead section of the BOM. MN001 Activated Carbon MN2XX All electrical connectors Once we have the frame and some other bits together, we'll gather more parts. 4. Extra Tips There are quite a few parts we'll only need one of, or will only need at certain times. On the other hand, we need screws for pretty much everything. Organizing your parts by category and purpose will quickly locate parts. Placing small parts in bags with their part number also helps. Keep a small box close with just the brackets, screws, and other fasteners. Leave electronics in their packaging until needed. They tend to go straight from box to some form of mount.","title":"Getting Ready & Organized"},{"location":"assembly/prep/#1-frame-pieces","text":"Pieces of frame of the same length have part numbers, but individual pieces also have an ID.

Before we start making a mess, let's make sure you have a few things and do get a few parts ready. 1. Frame You should have all of the aluminum extrusion pieces listed in the Framing section of the BOM. We're going to label the extrusion pieces next, so we recommend keeping them sorted by length and width for now. 2. Panels Before you begin assembly, it's a good idea to have the wood and acrylic panel fabrication completed. Sometimes it can take awhile to find a fabricator, get a quote, and have the work produced. We'll need the floor pieces to help align the Z axis crossbars, and all of the panel pieces are helpful in marking out the insulation cuts. If you plan to paint/stain and/or seal your panels, bear in mind that any sealant will need to have cured before attaching the insulation with adhesive. 3. Door Panel Gaskets The door panel gaskets (PNs 713 and 714) probably aren't cut to size yet. Keep them handy--we'll cut those shortly. 4. Insulation TODO 5. Printed Parts We'll be adding heat set inserts soon, so your printed parts need to be finished before then. 6. Wiring Unless you're having your wiring made or are experienced at wire crimping, we recommend practicing making connectors and watching/reading about crimping wires.

Secure The Carriages You'll need a few rubber bands, zip ties, or some other method of temporarily securing the carriages of your linear rails. Whatever your use, the carriage should remain in place. Note Later you will remove the rubber bumpers that keep the carriage on. This method will be the only thing keeping your carriage on the rail. 2. Check Rail Flatness Cheap linear rails often come slightly bowed, like so: This isn't indicative of quality, but it doesn't make the rail useless. With slight pressure: A determination still has to be made for each rail, however. Set each rail side by side. Sort them by how bowed them are. Check for any pits, dings, rust, or other damage. The flattest rail should be reserved for your X axis. The next best two use for the Y axis. Remaining rails that are usable will be used for the Z axis. Important Replace any rails that are excessively bowed and cannot be \"pressed flat\" easily, like above. Likewise, any rails with clear damage that will impact carriage motion should be replaced. 3. Lubricating Rails and Carriages Directions Linear rails ship with some form of protective grease. We not only need to remove that grease, we need to reapply our own lubricant. RatRig produced two excellent guides for cleaning and lubricating linear rails: Beginner Linear Rail Maintence Intermediate Linear Rail Maintenance The difference between the two guides is that in the second, the carriage is removed from the rail. This is the suggested method of lubricating your rail, but also runs the risk of the carriage bearings coming free. Use caution.

There are a lot of tee nuts. Thankfully, this goes quickly with the extrusions labeled. The list below is fairly straightforward: the ID of the extrusion, the number of tee nuts needed, and a picture of roughly where each tee nut goes. Click or tap the image to zoom in. Attention The tee nuts only need to be in the right channel and roughly in the right place. We will position them more precisely later. Orientation only matters when a tee nut is near the edge of an extrusion. When a tee nut is very near the edge, put the roller bearing end in first. See A3 for an example. Note that the hole is closer to the outer edge. Part List Rather than a table, we'll use a short list: Every extrusion 275x PN575, Tee Nut, 6mm Slot, M5, Roll In (all of them) 1.

Overview We designed Clock 3 with several rules related to sourcing and parts in mind: Every new line added to the BOM has an up front cost. Rare parts are expensive and hard to find, by definition. Standardized and de facto standard parts are cheaper and have more suppliers. Custom fabricated anything is expensive. With those rules in mind, we aim to both keep costs down and make sourcing parts as simple as possible. Keeping Track Every component that goes in to making a Clock 3 printer is assigned an ID number and categorized in several ways. Is it a printed part or something purchased? Does it require modification or assembly, such as finished cables or insulation cut to size? Is it an aid for assembly or maintence that isn't part of the printer itself? Finally, what is the general function of the part in the printer (e.g. frame, electronics, motion)? Categorization Let's talk about identifying the things you'll need to print, buy, or make. Parts are given a number with a two letter prefix and a three-digit number code, for example PN001 . Prefixes MN : Parts in the format MN### are raw materials. During the assembly process, they'll be modified or used to make something else. Typically this can't be reversed: examples are connector pins and heat shrink tubing. This list is not exhaustive--if you won't need to buy or assemble it, it's not given a number. For example, you probably won't cut the frame extrusions yourself, so we don't include the raw aluminum in the list. UN : These parts aren't actually part of the printer but you will need them to put it together or keep it running. You may already have some or all of these on hand, like a soldering iron or set of Metric hex wrenches. PN : These are finished parts, whether printed, purchased, or made from materials. They come in the format PN### . Note If the number after PN is less than 399, it's a printed part. Fabricated parts There are several kinds of these: Printed parts, with or without heat set inserts Cables and wiring harnesses Cut extrusions and panels With the exception of cables, all of these have part numbers in the form PN . Cables do still have an ID, but are tracked based on the component that they power. There's more on that later in the assembly guide. All of these fabricated parts require materials ( MN ). Consequently, some parts in the BOM are made entirely from materials.","title":"Bill of Materials Introduction"},{"location":"bom/#overview","text":"We designed Clock 3 with several rules related to sourcing and parts in mind: Every new line added to the BOM has an up front cost.

Clock 3 is still a prototype, so a wide variety of possible configurations have not yet been tested. There is still room for flexibility, however. Hotend The initial prototype is being tested with two hotends: an E3D V6 and a \"Haldis Red Lizard\" (Phaetus Dragonfly clone). Any V6-compatible hotend with the same heatsink height should work, as long as the width of the heatsink fits within the mount. Direct Drive (v. Bowden) Direct drive with a BMG extruder is currently the only supported configuration. Adding a Bowden configuration is planned, as are other extruders. This section is a placeholder until then. Door and Frame Door Assembly MISUMI sells complete door kits . We take a modular approach and buy the parts individually, but some may find a kit appealing. Note that one can purchase this door kit with or without an interior panel. These kits are composed of the following part numbers: Part Number Description MISUMI PN PN553 Screw, M5-0.8 x 16mm SHCS SCB5-16 PN710 Corner Bracket, Door Frame HBLTC5 PN713 2020 Door Panel Gasket, 564mm HFSSK3-2000 PN714 2020 Door Panel Gasket, 646mm HFSSK3-2000 PN751 2020 Door Extrusion, 564mm HFTF5-2020-564-TPW PN752 2020 Door Extrusion, 646mm HFTF5-2020-646-TPW PN760 Acrylic Sheet, 577x659x3mm (included in kit only) Note If you buy the interior panel from MISUMI instead of locally sourcing, shipping costs increase. Adding a panel to a kit only increases the price a few dollars but may increase shipping costs more. Additionally, a 90mm handle ships with the kit. It is not very comfortable and the screw holes are wrong for the outer panel; use the printed handle instead. If you have M5x16 SHCS on hand already and are having both panels made separately, buying the rest of the parts individually is more cost-effective. Windows Acrylic We use 3mm acrylic. If using 5mm inner window panels, change HFSSK3-2000 to HFSSK5-2000 when sourcing for the door panel gasket. It is possible to use a 5mm outer window panel, but this will require changes to the gasketing behind the door. Note At present, we know of no other supplier than MISUMI for this panel mounting gasket. Please notify us if another supplier is found. Polycarbonate (PC) Switching to PC for the inner panel is a more expensive option. There is no issue with using PC, nor are adjustments required. This can be done relatively affordably for the inner panel by buying a kit. Wooden Panels These will need to be locally fabricated. The wooden panels are 6mm and 12mm thick; approximately the same values in SAE plywood measurements will work with some adjustment. 12mm panels: 15/32\" is preferable 6mm panels: Should be thicker, if possible 5/16\". Insulation Polyisocyanurate foam is an excellent insulator with superior qualities to polystyrene (Styrofoam) and comparable price. The default thickness all around is 1/2\", but this can be increased as desired to better control chamber temperatures. Top insulation: up to 1\" thick. Floor insulation: up to 3/4\" thick (will need to be tested). Side insulation: up to 1\" thick. Rear insulation: up to 3/4\" thick; additional can be added with some adjustments. Electrical There are an incredible number of different approaches to wiring. While lever nuts can be used, we prefer a connector-based approach for robustness and space considerations. Where possible, any changes to wiring will only impact the Materials list and wiring panel mounts. The panel mounts only connect parts above the flooring, so using lever nuts solely for undercarriage connections is very easily doable. Lever Nuts The front-to-back Z crossbars are ideal mounting positions for lever nuts. In the future, a part holder for this purpose may be added; for now, you can find lots of examples on CAD and STL sharing sites. Cable Raceways/Wire Channels These have not been tested. Mounting the raceways might require additional parts beyond the raceways themselves.","title":"Decision Guide"},{"location":"bom/guide/#hotend","text":"The initial prototype is being tested with two hotends: an E3D V6 and a \"Haldis Red Lizard\" (Phaetus Dragonfly clone).

Press the inserts (preferably with a insert press) and note the characteristics: How readily the insert drops in: is there resistance? Does it seems to just fall right in without grabbing the plastic? There should be some resistance, but too much will cause plastic to bubble up inside the threads. The resulting plastic around the insert: does it raise at all above the insert? Is there a clear gap around the knurls? Is there a smooth transition between the plastic around the knurls and the untouched plastic? You're looking for the last of the three. The bottom of the insert: is it smooth? Did any plastic seep up from underneath? Too high signals your insert is not fully seated. Too low is caused by plastic coming up underneath the insert. Using the following three checks, move down and to the right, noting which insert \"feels\" right in each row (not too much pressure, not too little). If a taper of doesn't work for one row, don't re-use it for the next row. Keep moving down and to the right. Your finished product should look something like this picture . Note that an insert was plucked out (with tweezers!) before being fully inserted. If you feel too much resistance with insertion or generally feel it's the wrong size, it probably is the wrong size. Carefully look over the inserts and check depths with calipers. You're looking for the correct depth (5.8mm) and a smooth surface. In the picture, the ideal size wound up being 4.5 with a taper of -4 degrees (third row, third column). Updating the Fusion Model The Parameters file will need to be updated.
