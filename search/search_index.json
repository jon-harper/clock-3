Firstly, thanks for reading the Clock 3 Documentation. Overview This page relates to areas of the documentation where feedback is actively sought\u2014though any feedback is always welcome. It is grouped as a set of questions to answer about the documentation. This can be viewed as a literal list of questions or suggestions as a starting point for reviewing the documentation. Terminology First, let's establish terminology. The links on the left with arrows next to them are \"categories\". If a link sends you to a page and does not have children (no arrow), it is a \"page\". These contain actual content. Each page is divided into sections and subsections. On the right is a \"Table of Contents\". Every page has one, and each Table of Contents will let you jump quickly from section to section. With that said, we'll start with navigation, which relates to the above. Navigation Clarity: Without the explanation above about categories/pages and sections/subsections: Is it obvious what page one is on (is it clear on the left that this is the TODO List page)? Is the Table of Contents visible enough as a TOC (font size, color, etc.)? Should there be an area explaining navigation on the Overview page? Conversely, would this be too low-level for a technical audience? Links Are there enough in-site links (links from one page to another)? Are external navigation links, such as to guides, clear enough? Appearance Are the font sizes and styles appropriate? Should heading color be adjusted for sections and subsections to help with visual clarity? Alternatively, should a divider be used between sections to aid the color blind and/or add visual space? Content Does each section page have a sufficient introduction, i.e. if arrived at without viewing the previous page, is it clear what the section page contains? Should photos or wireframes projections be preferred for directions when either is available?","title":"Editing/Reviewing/TODO"},{"location":"todo/#overview","text":"This page relates to areas of the documentation where feedback is actively sought\u2014though any feedback is always welcome.

General Questions Why another 3D printer? Note TODO This is a longer story that I'd like to get right. Can I get a kit from somewhere? That would be super cool, but not at the moment. Can you build one for me? No, but a Bill of Materials is in the final stages of verification and formatting. In addition, documentation on the assembly and configuration process is ongoing. Will you come work for my company? Hey, that's a cool idea. Here's my LinkedIn . Reach out and we'll find out. Conceptual Why so many lock washers? A bag of 500 lock washers costs not much more than 100. A builder will need more than 100 lock washers no matter what I do, so I standardized on M5 screw + lock washer + tee nut where it is reasonable to do so. Also, Loctite eats ABS if it's not completely dry, and there's a lot of it in this printer. Why a V6 hotend instead of [x]? Several reasons: V6 clones are readily available and generally only differ in length with respect to compatibility the mount interface can be reused for other hotends that are \"groove mount\" style, like the newer Dragon hotends. Why does the Z axis not have a third driver? That's on the todo list for the future. Given time and cost constraints, two steppers has to do for now. With silicone columns and a BLTouch for assisted leveling, it's less a problem than a \"nice to have\". I have studied the RatRig design and find their three-point leveling design exceptional. Future iterations of this project may adapt a similar bearing-style magnetic mount. Why not a larger build volume? I strongly considered this, but settled on the Creality CR-10 form factor. Going larger starts becoming quite troublesome: Overall increase in cost beyond 310x310mm Power usage scales nonlinearly, as bed volume scales quadratically and chamber volume cubically. CR-10 build plates are cheap and readily available. 350mm build plates (and larger) are harder to come by. A 300mm^2 build plate can still reasonably be heated with a built-in DC heater. Larger areas require AC pads, which means adding a relay, a cutoff, more wiring...and more risk if mis-installed. The Z volume is limited somewhat by the stepper being placed outside of the chamber. This necessarily sacrifices about 150mm of thread, and a 500mm lead screw is already hard enough to get aligned. However , MIC-6 aluminum build plates are plentiful enough now that a future revision of this project will likely switch over to using one. Why don't you use M4 screws? To keep the number and type of screws down. This project is made entirely of M3 and M5 screws with the exception of the bed and PSU, which both require M4 fasteners for mounting. Materials and Sourcing Do I have to use the same brands for materials (e.g. Misumi)? Most of the printer is substitutable with OEM materials. Although initial support is only provided for the BIGTREETECH Octopus MCU, a FYSETC S6 or Spider would theoretically work just as well. The only part that can't be substituted without major work is the Raspberry Pi. There is a really good supplier that sells custom [x]. Why don't you use their product? I'm avoiding single-source parts (Raspberry Pi and MISUMI door frame notwithstanding). Ideally this will keep costs down as well as prevent supply and sourcing issues. Can I use Neopixels (WS2812B, 5V) instead of WS2815 (12V)? Yes. You can even use a different driver, like APA102, as long as it uses no more than 4 wires (VCC, GND, and one or two data). The SP901E is a data repeater and compatible across a range of voltages. That said, you may see a small difference in lighting quality with a 5V LED string like the Neopixel due to voltage drop across 2 meters of wire.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"about/faq/#general-questions","text":"","title":"General Questions"},{"location":"about/faq/#why-another-3d-printer","text":"Note TODO This is a longer story that I'd like to get right.","title":"Why another 3D printer?"},{"location":"about/faq/#can-i-get-a-kit-from-somewhere","text":"That would be super cool, but not at the moment.","title":"Can I get a kit from somewhere?"},{"location":"about/faq/#can-you-build-one-for-me","text":"No, but a Bill of Materials is in the final stages of verification and formatting.

Ease of Sourcing Use off-the-shelf components where possible: 400mm linear rails and 500mm lead screws were chosen for ready availability. JST-SM connectors are used for low-current connections. Limit switches are Makerbot/Creality-type. Heated bed is a stock Creality CR-10 bed (310mmx310mm). Heater cartridge connectors are compatible with E3D V6 cartridges. Minimize the number of fastener types: Fasteners are M3 button head or M5 socket head cap screws. Minor exceptions are all readily available and small in number. Care is taken to avoid adding new fastener lengths or types unless necessary. Custom-fabricated components are few and easily sourced: Panels have a minimal number of holes and cuts. Vector paths for laser cuts are provided. Floor panels have gaps with printed cutouts for wiring passthrough. Wiring is then connected to a concealed panel mount underneath the flooring. Frame relies on perpendicular braces, largely avoiding tapped ends. Blind joints or counterbored and tapped holes are completely unused. Ease of Access, Service, and Modification Designed for ease of assembly and simple cable management: Parts have printed ID numbers to help identification. Left- and right-handed parts are notated with a printed L or R , as well. Many printed components integral zip tie anchors and cable guides. Components are made to be serviceable and accessible: Disassembly of most kinematic components does not require other components to be disassembled first. A gantry lock design is included to keep the gantry in place and square during belt servicing. Side and rear panels unscrew and take the insulation with them: Components and cabling are almost entirely separated, i.e. electrical components can be unplugged from a harness. Easy, direct access to electronics through two individually-removeable floor panels. Side panels use drop-in tee nuts for quick removal and reattachment. Flexibility, Safety, and Stability Designed parametrically for flexible build parameters: The core Fusion 360 file can be adjusted for different print tolerances. Build volume can be scaled up (capability is maintained, but this is not actively developed yet). Different types and depths of heated inserts can be used; likewise, adjustments can be made for different print tolerances. NOTE: The pace of development occured technical debt in this area. V0.8/v0.9 (after completed documentation) will involve a significant rework of the Fusion 360 model. Built in air filtration and ambient temperature control: Dual fans for recirculated and vented air, fed through both activated carbon and HEPA filters. Filtration system is in steady production use. Use of polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam insulation allows for steady chamber temperatures with only air exhaust for cooling.

Assembly involves a large number of individual parts. We'll do our best to divide the process up into manageable chunks. For the purposes of this guide, instructions are for an unmodified version of the Clock 3 prototype. Warning We will be working with electricity and carefully positioning parts. Patience and caution are needed. Rushing any part of assembly now can cause issues later or even be hazardous . Take your time, take breaks, and double-check your work! A Guided Tour Below are the stages of the assembly process. Bear in mind that not all steps take the same amount of time. Preparation This stage is much like setting up a construction site. We need to figure out where to put our tools and supplies. Check that we have all of the supplies we need. Do some early work and prepare for the rest of the assembly. Framing Building Blocks The first step is the frame. We'll assemble it in several pieces and check for a square, rigid assembly. Kinematics This is a four step process. Essentially, we start with the Z steppers and build up and in towards the X gantry. Lastly, we fasten the belts. Z Axis XY Axes X Gantry Belts Electronics, Part 1 At this point, we'll have much of the topside of the printer done. Before we wire anything, everything that needs a connector should be in place. This is where we unbox the control board, hotend, and install the rest of the steppers. Wiring Here we'll start measuring out wires, cutting them to roughly the right length, and generally getting ready to make a lot of cabling. Electronics, Part 2 At this point, it's time to make connectors and actually run our finished cabling. We start from the MCU and work our way up. Finishing Up and Closing Up The is the last of the hardware setup, where we install the door, side panels, and air filtration. We'll check for a solid seal in the chamber and resolve any issues. Conventions Like with the categorization of parts in the Bill of Materials, there are other conventions we use during the assembly process to identify parts and orient them quickly. We will introduce them as we go through the Preparation section of this Guide. Outside Guides and Documentation Links At various points during assembly and configuration, guides for certain tasks are already available from the manufacturer, developer, or maintainer (or simply a third party). We will often link to an external guide for more detailed explanations of some procedures. An example of this is in the initial configuration of MainsailOS . The developers of Mainsail will always have more current documentation regarding installation and setup than ours, so we defer to them where needed.

Note In this section we will be cutting polyisocyanurate foam (PIR foam, often called \"polyiso\"). Several tips: PIR foam tears easily, so use a blade with a straight edge. Additionally, the aluminum radiant barrier on one side is very thin and tears easily. You will need a sharp blade to get a clean cut. When in doubt, cut wide and pare down to fit in place later. Caution Do not try to make a crease on side and cut the other: the crease that appears on the uncut part of the foam will not align with the precut area. Instead cut halfway, then cut a second or third time more deeply over the first until breaking through. Use a piece of cardboard underneath the foam to avoid cutting anything important underneath the foam and/or damaging your blade. A.

The information here will both help you understand the rest of the guide and offer a few tips, as well. 1. Frame Pieces Pieces of frame of the same length have part numbers, but individual pieces also have an ID. These help locate where on the frame a piece goes and when inserting roll-in tee nuts. It's important to label each piece so that once we start inserting tee nuts, we don't get the pieces confused. To preserve our own sanity during development, we started labeling frame pieces in the same place, using the FTL rule: F ront T op L eft Every frame piece is labeled with its ID in the front, top left corner of where it belongs on the printer . If the front is a cut face on the extrusion, we put a label on the top, in the front left corner instead. This is a consistent strategy we use throughout this assembly guide. Here's an example of a labeled part and how the FTL scheme works in practice. This picture is of frame piece A1 , which is stickered in the upper left. With this as a reference, we can show each face of the extrusion and where the tee nuts belong. We will label each piece before we get started assembling the frame. For the moment, keep them organized by length/part number. 2. Printed Part Numbers Most printed parts have their part number embossed somewhere. Once installed the number won't be visible--they are solely there to help you find the part you are looking for. Anything without a part number is labeled in the notes column of the Bill of Materials. We recommend putting these unnumbered parts in bags and labeling them. Note Parts are also labeled with an 'L' or 'R' if there are two parts that are mirrors. 3. The Later Area There are some things you won't need until near the very end of assembly. We can set these parts in \"Later Area\" to keep what you don't need immediately stored. Here's the list: ID Description PN9XX The entire Electrical section of the BOM. PN8XX The entire Misc. section of the BOM. PN797 Foam Weatherstripping PN4XX The entire Toolhead section of the BOM. MN001 Activated Carbon MN2XX All electrical connectors Once we have the frame and some other bits together, we'll gather more parts. 4. Extra Tips There are quite a few parts we'll only need one of, or will only need at certain times. On the other hand, we need screws for pretty much everything. Organizing your parts by category and purpose will quickly locate parts. Placing small parts in bags with their part number also helps. Keep a small box close with just the brackets, screws, and other fasteners. Leave electronics in their packaging until needed. They tend to go straight from box to some form of mount.","title":"Getting Ready & Organized"},{"location":"assembly/prep/#1-frame-pieces","text":"Pieces of frame of the same length have part numbers, but individual pieces also have an ID.

Extra Tips"},{"location":"assembly/prep/fabrication/","text":"This document is actively being refined and edited for mistaeks. Before we start making a mess, let's make sure you have a few things and do get a few parts ready. 1. Frame You should have all of the aluminum extrusion pieces listed in the Framing section of the BOM. We're going to label the extrusion pieces next, so we recommend keeping them sorted by length and width for now. 2. Panels Before you begin assembly, it's a good idea to have the wood and acrylic panel fabrication completed. Sometimes it can take awhile to find a fabricator, get a quote, and have the work produced. We'll need the floor pieces to help align the Z axis crossbars, and all of the panel pieces are helpful in marking out the insulation cuts. If you plan to paint/stain and/or seal your panels, bear in mind that any sealant will need to have cured before attaching the insulation with adhesive. 3. Door Panel Gaskets The door panel gaskets (PNs 713 and 714) probably aren't cut to size yet. Keep them handy--we'll cut those shortly. 4. Insulation TODO 5. Printed Parts We'll be adding heat set inserts soon, so your printed parts need to be finished before then. 6. Wiring Unless you're having your wiring made or are experienced at wire crimping, we recommend practicing making connectors and watching/reading about crimping wires. Warning Poor electrical connections and loose wiring can cause a fire. It's very important that you're able to consistently make good crimps.

Secure The Carriages You'll need a few rubber bands, zip ties, or some other method of temporarily securing the carriages of your linear rails. Whatever your use, the carriage should remain in place. Note Later you will remove the rubber bumpers that keep the carriage on. This method will be the only thing keeping your carriage on the rail. 2. Check Rail Flatness Cheap linear rails often come slightly bowed, like so: This isn't indicative of quality, but it doesn't make the rail useless. With slight pressure: A determination still has to be made for each rail, however. Set each rail side by side. Sort them by how bowed them are. Check for any pits, dings, rust, or other damage. The flattest rail should be reserved for your X axis. The next best two use for the Y axis. Remaining rails that are usable will be used for the Z axis. Important Replace any rails that are excessively bowed and cannot be \"pressed flat\" easily, like above. Likewise, any rails with clear damage that will impact carriage motion should be replaced. 3. Lubricating Rails and Carriages Directions Linear rails ship with some form of protective grease. We not only need to remove that grease, we need to reapply our own lubricant. RatRig produced two excellent guides for cleaning and lubricating linear rails: Beginner Linear Rail Maintence Intermediate Linear Rail Maintenance The difference between the two guides is that in the second, the carriage is removed from the rail. This is the suggested method of lubricating your rail, but also runs the risk of the carriage bearings coming free. Use caution. Note If you are using grease, you will need to remove the carriage for application.

Basic Steps Step Example Insert a tee nut in the channel Use the screw hole as a peephole to guide the rail over the nut Drop an M3 x 8mm screw in place Rotate the screw to level with the linear rail. Do not tighten fully. Slide in the next tee nut and move the rail fowards. This is easier when one hand is not taking a picture. Drop in a screw and secure Don't overtighten; slide forward B. Rescuing Lost Screws Problem Example If a screw misses a tee nut and falls in, back out the rail until you can \"pop\" the screw up with your finger. Use an allen wrench to re-align the rail with the tee nut Add another screw and secure Fixed! C. Finishing Step Example Continue adding nuts and screws until all 16 are populated.

Thankfully, this goes quickly with the extrusions labeled. The list below is fairly straightforward: the ID of the extrusion, the number of tee nuts needed, and a picture of roughly where each te`e nut goes. Click or tap the image to zoom in. Attention The tee nuts only need to be in the right channel and roughly in the right place. We will position them more precisely later. Orientation only matters when a tee nut is near the edge of an extrusion. When a tee nut is very near the edge, put the roller bearing end in first. See A3 for an example.

Overview We designed Clock 3 with several rules related to sourcing and parts in mind: Every new line added to the BOM has an up front cost. Rare parts are expensive and hard to find, by definition. Standardized and de facto standard parts are cheaper and have more suppliers. Custom fabricated anything is expensive. With those rules in mind, we aim to both keep costs down and make sourcing parts as simple as possible. Keeping Track Every component that goes in to making a Clock 3 printer is assigned an ID number and categorized in several ways. Is it a printed part or something purchased? Does it require modification or assembly, such as finished cables or insulation cut to size? Is it an aid for assembly or maintence that isn't part of the printer itself? Finally, what is the general function of the part in the printer (e.g. frame, electronics, motion)? Categorization Let's talk about identifying the things you'll need to print, buy, or make. Parts are given a number with a two letter prefix and a three-digit number code, for example PN001 . Prefixes MN : Parts in the format MN### are raw materials. During the assembly process, they'll be modified or used to make something else. Typically this can't be reversed: examples are connector pins and heat shrink tubing. This list is not exhaustive--if you won't need to buy or assemble it, it's not given a number. For example, you probably won't cut the frame extrusions yourself, so we don't include the raw aluminum in the list. UN : These parts aren't actually part of the printer but you will need them to put it together or keep it running. You may already have some or all of these on hand, like a soldering iron or set of Metric hex wrenches. PN : These are finished parts, whether printed, purchased, or made from materials. They come in the format PN### . Note If the number after PN is less than 399, it's a printed part. Fabricated parts There are several kinds of these: Printed parts, with or without heat set inserts Cables and wiring harnesses Cut extrusions and panels With the exception of cables, all of these have part numbers in the form PN . Cables also have an ID, but it is tracked based on the component that the cable powers. There's more on that later in the assembly guide. All of these fabricated parts require materials (parts starting with MN ). Consequently, some parts in the BOM are made entirely from materials.","title":"Bill of Materials Introduction"},{"location":"bom/#overview","text":"We designed Clock 3 with several rules related to sourcing and parts in mind: Every new line added to the BOM has an up front cost.

Clock 3 is still a prototype, so a wide variety of possible configurations have not yet been tested. There is still room for flexibility, however. Hotend The initial prototype is being tested with two hotends: an E3D V6 and a \"Haldis Red Lizard\" (Phaetus Dragonfly clone). Any V6-compatible hotend with the same heatsink height should work, as long as the width of the heatsink fits within the mount. Direct Drive (v. Bowden) Direct drive with a BMG extruder is currently the only supported configuration. Adding a Bowden configuration is planned, as are other extruders. This section is a placeholder until then. Door and Frame Door Assembly MISUMI sells complete door kits . We take a modular approach and buy the parts individually, but some may find a kit appealing. Note that one can purchase this door kit with or without an interior panel. These kits are composed of the following part numbers: Part Number Description MISUMI PN PN553 Screw, M5-0.8 x 16mm SHCS SCB5-16 PN710 Corner Bracket, Door Frame HBLTC5 PN713 2020 Door Panel Gasket, 564mm HFSSK3-2000 PN714 2020 Door Panel Gasket, 646mm HFSSK3-2000 PN751 2020 Door Extrusion, 564mm HFTF5-2020-564-TPW PN752 2020 Door Extrusion, 646mm HFTF5-2020-646-TPW PN760 Acrylic Sheet, 577x659x3mm (included in kit only) Note If you buy the interior panel from MISUMI instead of locally sourcing, shipping costs increase. Adding a panel to a kit only increases the price a few dollars but may increase shipping costs more. Additionally, a 90mm handle ships with the kit. It is not very comfortable and the screw holes are wrong for the outer panel; use the printed handle instead. If you have M5x16 SHCS on hand already and are having both panels made separately, buying the rest of the parts individually is more cost-effective. Windows Acrylic We use 3mm acrylic. If using 5mm inner window panels, change HFSSK3-2000 to HFSSK5-2000 when sourcing for the door panel gasket. It is possible to use a 5mm outer window panel, but this will require changes to the gasketing behind the door. Note At present, we know of no other supplier than MISUMI for this panel mounting gasket. Please notify us if another supplier is found. Polycarbonate (PC) Switching to PC for the inner panel is a more expensive option. There is no issue with using PC, nor are adjustments required. This can be done relatively affordably for the inner panel by buying a kit. Wooden Panels These will need to be locally fabricated. The wooden panels are 6mm and 12mm thick; approximately the same values in SAE plywood measurements will work with some adjustment. 12mm panels: 15/32\" is preferable 6mm panels: Should be thicker, if possible 5/16\". Insulation Polyisocyanurate foam is an excellent insulator with superior qualities to polystyrene (Styrofoam) and comparable price. The default thickness all around is 1/2\", but this can be increased as desired to better control chamber temperatures. Top insulation: up to 1\" thick. Floor insulation: up to 3/4\" thick (will need to be tested). Side insulation: up to 1\" thick. Rear insulation: up to 3/4\" thick; additional can be added with some adjustments. Electrical There are an incredible number of different approaches to wiring. While lever nuts can be used, we prefer a connector-based approach for robustness and space considerations. Where possible, any changes to wiring will only impact the Materials list and wiring panel mounts. The panel mounts only connect parts above the flooring, so using lever nuts solely for undercarriage connections is very easily doable. Lever Nuts The front-to-back Z crossbars are ideal mounting positions for lever nuts. In the future, a part holder for this purpose may be added; for now, you can find lots of examples on CAD and STL sharing sites. Cable Raceways/Wire Channels These have not been tested. Mounting the raceways might require additional parts beyond the raceways themselves. Ribbon Cables This is currently being tested and checked for quality sources of silicone ribbon cable, particularly brands that are marked in pairs or rainbow. Multi-core Cables These technically should work but are costly (particularly IGUS's 10+ core cables). Bundling in shielded multi-core cables may be particularly helpful for signal wires, e.g. ABL and endstops, as an alternative to twisting wires.","title":"Decision Guide"},{"location":"bom/guide/#hotend","text":"The initial prototype is being tested with two hotends: an E3D V6 and a \"Haldis Red Lizard\" (Phaetus Dragonfly clone).

Q2 2022 2022-06-06 Tweaked latch designs somewhat for cleaner appearance and open/close action (PN129-PN131). Tweaked initial floor tab design (PN132). Smaller and actually fits! Continuing to evolve ideas for hotend/extruder/part fan mount. Relocated a number of doc files for better access to info from the landing page. 2022-06-04 Added feet resolved stability issues, though a more stable surface would still help. Printing both ABS and PLA today . Started work on a new hotend/gantry carriage format. Still deciding best directions, however: Footprint is narrower Ducting is much tigher to the heatsink on the X axis to help with directed cooling; Hotend cage is 6mm shorter on Y axis, as well Still early on designing this, so it'll be awhile before I find a good combination of component mounting methods and arrangement. 2022-06-03 Added PN131, a lower door latch. Also working on PN132, a spinning latch for the floor panels. Gasketing went in perfectly. Clock 3 is sealed. 2022-06-01 Fixed Z axis issue\u2014the anti-backlash nut wasn't secured properly on Z2. Printing successfully today. 2022-05-31 Modified the door latch for wider opening arc. Testing TPU door seals and gaskets. Currently testing TPU with E6000 glue and have Loctite 406 on order. 2022-05-30 Fixed numerous kinematic values for steppers. XYZE are all calibrated now. Made a custom temp map for the thermistor I'm using. Stability issues. Not sure if bed or gantry. Added PN129 and PN130 for a front door latch. 2022-05-29 RGB lights do not work, possibly because of the SP901E. I have replaced these with 12V white LEDs for now. Chamber is sealed except for the around the flooring edges. May another gasketing material. Hotend thermistor is inaccurate. Going to create a resistance table. Door and all panels are back on. Kinematics work. Fans for both chamber and electronics are configured and working. 2022-05-28 Undercarriage wiring is in with no issue. Chamber is now sealed except for: Door gasketing Side panel weatherseal Wiring tunnels (left and right) New panel mount works nicely. 2022-05-27 Finishing up the first electronics section and wiring details. Steppers mount on the panels with no issue. Side panels work, although initial mounting of the couplers is tough. Switching to final color scheme; looking good. 2022-05-21/22 Panel mount can be adapted and will be. Have already pushed changes to hotend for BLTouch mount points; will add BLTouch adapter later after testing. Z Axis assembly largely finished; outline done for Z Axis section of the documentation. Mostly done with XY axes outline. 2022-05-12 Had some catastrophic issues with multiple SKR 2s. Had to switch over to Octopus 1.1s, which required a new control case. That took a week. I have two printers up and expect to have a third printing ABS by tomorrow. Testing with Clock 3 hotend cooling assembly and BMG on an Ender 5 is going extremely well. Also testing a hotend panel mount on an Ender 5. BLTouch will need some work, so opened issue #50. 2022-04-27 Still working on documentation. I took a week off to solve some long-term issues and test out a few things. Documentation is now merged into the clock-3 repo instead of being its own repo. This will simplify a lot of things. 2022-04-17 Doing a lot of experimentation and testing right now, as well as catching up on maintenance. Focus ATM is testing the hotend & related assemblies on an Ender 5, including a new wiring panel mount. Will adapt for Clock 3 afteward. 2022-04-14 Making heavy progress documenting assembly. Panels are finished, insulation is 80% done. Made a number of model fixes based on assembly experience, all related to fasteners. 2022-04-11 Finished testing Micro Fit 3 profile, updated PN070 Fixed #45 2022-04-08 Made some milestone changes. See below. Adjusted due date for 0.4.5 (pre-assembly testing). Although the Micro Fit 3 profile is done, it's not tested. The BOM needs to be broken out into the Sales BOM and the Manufacturing/Assembly BOM. This (kinda) exists with the Materials/Parts sections, but they are different things and need to be broken out. Documentation is progressing steadily in parallel, but can't progress while the BOM is changing (i.e. reference points might change). 2022-04-07 Today is yesterday on repeat, but with more progress. jon-harper.github.io/clock3-docs/ is live, if incomplete. 2022-04-06 Continuing to flesh out the documentation basics Started sealing the panels with polyurethane. 2022-04-05 Filling out docs in earnest now. Rigid coupler link in the part list/BOM is now correct Documentation changes are now tracked in the documentation repository. 2022-04-04 BomDialog now exports both CSV and Markdown formats. Panels are sanded and ready for better weather to apply PUR. Pushed first working BOM exporter with Markdown support. Documentation framework is progressing steadily. Created a panel mount profile for the MicroFit 3.0 dual row, two pin connector. Earth wire is now 16awg. Lots of added links and corrections in the part list. Updated /Scripts readme text. 2022-04-03 Apparently never exported PN127 and 128, the TPU wire conduits. This is fixed. Continued prepping panels for sanding and sealing Significant progress on BOM export as a Markdown file. 2022-04-02 Setup clock3-docs repository and MkDocs. Started work on a new script to re-format the BomDialog output CSV file into Markdown. This will possibly make its way directly into Clock3Scripts, but it's useful enough to leave it in the /Scripts folder. Spent much of the morning setting up to seal the panels in polyurethane. 2022-04-01 Assembled exterior frame, planned assembly order. Checked panels for fit. Removed extrusion channel guide from frame feet. This should greatly speed up the print time and reduce supports. Re-ordered Micro-Fit 3.0 panel mount connectors. USPS mis-delivered my package. Will likely use Jekyll for docs. Found the missing tee nut. BOM and model are now fully in sync and verified. Relabeled all extrusions with cleaner labeling Q1 2022 2022-03-30 Added more layout files for exporting STLs Exploring documentation formats Picked up completed panels (YES!) Began \"pre-assembly\" of frame 2022-03-29 Export BOM dialog works (mostly). Pushed an update to Clock3Scripts. Exported a working, auto-exported bill of materials. Removed old scripts folder and put in placeholder. Firmware folder is now just a readme.md with information on where to find the Klipper config and such. 2022-03-28 Added a new repository for the Fusion scripts: Clock3Scripts. Migrated old scripting issues to Clock3Scripts. Added new linear rail alignment tools for during assembly. 2022-03-27 Added a printed number to PN033, the front mount plate. Two new renders of the model with final panels. Verified all printed part counts and heat set inserts against BOM. Tested LED mount length. I believe the BOM is correct with respect to Micro Fit 3.0 connectors, although the panel mount parts are not here yet. 2022-03-26 There is a literal, phantom tee nut in the model. I have counted component by component three different ways. The's an extra tee nut hidden in the model. =( In the process of counting, Connectors.xlsx is taking on new responsibilities, i.e. it's now named ID Lists.xlsx and contains information on parts that require fabrication or assembly: frame + tee nuts, printed parts + heat set inserts, and all of the cables. 2022-03-25 Frame Identification.pdf now has handy arrows to the front, top left corner of each piece and an explanation of the labeling system. Switched hotend wiring to 20awg and connector to Micro Fit 3. Fixed #42 (A/B steppers have pigtailed connectors now) Chasing a phantom tee nut. 2022-03-24 Created a set of drawings to identify and label frame components Spent most of the day locating and counting M5 roll in tee nuts. 2022-03-23 Fixed #39 in the model. Fixed #35. Reprinting. Added more wire anchors to the model. Added a subfolder in /CAD called Font . Inside is Hack, the monospace font used for labeling part numbers. A readme and links to the project page are included. Fixed #41 by modeling the USB C buck converter. Started a Fusion plugin to collect scripts. Fixed #38. 2022-03-22 Opened a lot of issues and a new milestone. New render. Nearly all components are counted from the BOM. Set side panel depth to 6mm to fit all panels on 1x 4'x5'x12mm sheet and 1x 4'x5'x6mm sheet. Will need to rework acrylic to 3mm. 6mm total with an air gap is sufficient. This was pointed out by the fabricator (thank you, Michael). Finalized laser cut layout and submitted for fabrication. Started modeling PTFE filament guide. 2022-03-21 Integrating printed parts to general part list. Parts have new, simpler name scheme and .stl filenames are auto-generated. Now to update the model... New PN070-073 (electrical panel mounts). Removed panel mount frames, PN074 and PN075. Renamed STL files to match new naming scheme. Inserted panel mounts into the model. Added PIR foam cutouts for panel mounts, which were previously missing. Have not updated drawings yet. Updated each component in the model with new Description fields and checked for issues. Fixed #31. PSU now uses M4x8mm BHCS. Uploading an initial, mostly verified, bill of materials. Fixed depth of external couplers on the side panels. 2022-03-20 Working on issue #28 fairly steadily. All wire runs will now have an ID to aid tracking and assembly. Wire IDs are based on component IDs IDs not involving the PSU are tailed with a letter code indicating distance from MCU, e.g. HE-A is MCU->chamber panel mount, HE-B is from the right chamber panel to the tooldhead panel. There are a few third level connectors with a -C. The modified BLTouch wire is ABL-C and connects to ABL-B. Likewise, I included a -C for LED strips. Even though they are soldered on, they still have to be made by the builder. Added initial drawings for foam insulation to the /BOM folder Tallied and labeled all wires, connectors, and pins. Updated ExtractBOM_PN. File location is currently hardcoded and it lacks a UI, but those are already on the radar. 2022-03-19 Adjusted dimensions to be uniform 6 or 12mm for panels due to material availability. Updated model and laser cut sketches. Working on a new panel mount design. 2022-03-18 Laid out panels for laser cutting on 4'x5' sheets. Now have both engineering sketches and laser cut paths in the BOM folder; closing #33 2022-03-17 Finished draft of engineering sketches. Several more renders of the panels for the fabricator to see. Re-export PN016, the stepper mounts, as I forgot on the 16th. 2022-03-16 Completely remodeled the outside frame and panels, as the timeline was already in bad shape. It finally got corrupted and I threw it out and started over. The results are much cleaner. AB stepper mounts are 5mm shorter (again). Restarting engineering sketches again due to frame and panel problems. Should go much more quickly. 2022-03-15 Modeled piano hinge Attempted to update the the Outside Frame file and on to finish the drawings, but Fusion is crashing constantly. Will need to merge printed part list in to General Part List.xlsx for proper export as a CSV. Exported first completed set of panel sketches. 2022-03-14 Cleanup and tweaking to the readme file. Lots of issue and milestone cleanups. Preparing General Part List.xlsx to be exported as a .csv file instead of tab-delimited. Will need to merge printed part list into the general file. Added a value column and merged the default values. The Fusion Python script now reads in the CSV file and optionally includes default values, then scrapes the model for part numbers, and exports to a specified file. The UI does not work correctly. It appears, but events do not fire properly. 2022-03-12 Added printed part numbers to PN123 and PN124 Minor edits and updates to the General Parts List . 2022-03-11 Picked up on learning Fusion's UI API. It's built on Qt, so very familiar. 2022-03-10 Learned a few lessons and laid out the panels as derived objects in a separate file, then created the drawings from that. Waiting on a piano hinge to draw up the top panel and hatch. All other fabricated pieces have drawings now. Exported the initial sketches (minus the top) to the /BOM folder. 2022-03-09 Top hatch is now 300mm deep instead of 390. This leaves room for a spool holder on top of the printer. Continuing to work on drawings. Multiple new renders to illustrate paneling. 2022-03-08 Exported initial designs for panels and a mockup of panels/frame to discuss with fabricator. Began engineering drawings for panels. 2022-03-06 Finished disassembling frame. Modified base foot design to accomodate roll-in tee nuts. Now verifying total on hand count against the model. Aside from count verification, BOM just needs connector count and cable lengths. Closed disassembly milestone. 2022-03-05 Re-exported PN099. File somehow got lost without being replaced. More fastener length fixes. 2022-03-04 Continuing model and BOM verification. Working on kinematic components today. Restored PN088, the camera base. Added a linear rail plug that can be printed in TPU in case they are lost (I need them right now; figured they can't hurt). Lot of corrections to fastener sizes. 2022-03-03 Continued model/BOM verification. Lots of fastener adjustments, but no major surprises The electrical panel mount will definitely need redesign, and the PSU mount is dubious. Also need a mount for the new RPi buck converter. 2022-03-02 Began verification of BOM and model. Replaced M5x12 SHCS for the doors with M5x16. Shortened air filter base stand top 2mm. 2022-03-01 Moved exhaust hose and PTFE coupler exits. Panels are no longer identical but this is much simpler to work around. FPD of wire conduit for the paneling. Since there is no physical paneling yet, the conduit will definitely need revision later. This is mostly to ensure it's doable, counted in the BOM, and have something to test when the paneling is fabricated. Model is now missing only lock collars for the F688 alignment bearings. Only remaining design necessary for a complete prototype are TPU gaskets for the front door. Changes definitely need to be made around the hotend and (later) the Z axis, but an enclosed prototype is almost here. BOM is accurately generated for all printed parts but lock collars and some extra zip tie anchors. Added the aluminum facing for PIR foam, fixed numerous issues. Several new renders. Added quite a few zip tie anchors to the model, as well. Added foam weather stripping to the sides of the floor panels. 2022-02-28 Massive number of small edits to filenames, Printed Part List.xlsx and model to ensure consistency. Updated Raspberry Pi in the model, adding heatsink, HDMI adapter, and SD card. Removed even more stale STL files. Added PN111, a fan finger guard with about the right amount of spacing for a M3x35mm screw. Added SD cards, thumb screws, and other small details to the models. Updated the Readme file with my spare time while Fusion saves. Designed two styles of pull handles: one is narrow to fit the V-slot door, the other is 25mm wide for everywhere else. PN125 and 126 Started work on wire pass-thrus for the flooring. 2022-02-27 Removing PN095 and 097, as the panels are done and no M5 inserts were needed. Renumbered PN089 to PN095. It's now circular and is used on all A/B and Z steppers for a near-airtight seal. Added PN123 and PN124, the bearing slider mounts for the Z axis (left and right). All printed part file names have three-digit numbers now, e.g. 090 - Misc - Frame - Corner Bracket Cover.stl . This will help sorting on every platform other than Windows. Printed Part List.xlsx is updated to reflect three-digit file names, as well. Added PN122, a PTFE tube guide for between the pneumatic connectors for PN120 Fixed outside panel coupler dimensions for new panel widths. Moved some brackets slightly to work with thicker floor panel. Modeled all remaining insulation and added relevant parts. Finished adding fasteners to the floor panels. Working on ensuring the air filtration both fits and can exhaust easily. This may require work, but is doable. 2022-02-26 Set panel thickness to 7/32\" or ~5.56mm for front panel. Side panels and top are now 5/16\". Rear panel and flooring is 7/16\". Updating model positions and sketches. Deleted STL files for SKR board mount, as the board itself is currently unsupported. Running hard against physical memory limits with Fusion when loading the master model. Pagefiles are still on spinning disks on my machine, not flash, so pagefile thrashing hurts and is possibly causing crashes. Fixed the alignment of a few brackets. Floor panel dimensions are in. Still finishing adding insulation and fasteners. 2022-02-25 Lots of part corrections in the model. Modeled and added the 3mm spring steel build plate. Finished the front door and related components in the model. Added M5x14 FHCS to the BOM. Cleaned up the frame components to be external references instead of internal. Will fix the XY and rest of Z axis tomorrow. PTFE coupler and hose exhaust work well--will need TPU guide between the pneumatic couplers to align the PTFE tubes. Readme edits. Two new renders added. 2022-02-24 Assembled and measured door. Approximate clearance with MISUMI hinges is 4-5mm on the handle side. FPD of hose exhaust and PTFE coupler for side panels. Adding PN120 and PN121. Testing stability of door. I've mocked up spacers that are as thick as the paneling, but I believe they are allowing the door to sag. Modified PN092, the frame base foot, to work with BHCS. Corrected a few file names against the master log. 2022-02-23 Modified AB stepper mounts and TPU shim to sit on top panel. Extended AB stepper mount height, now uses M5 x 60mm BHCS. Added PN089, a stepper alignment slider. It's a TPU plug for where the linear rods from the AB steppers enter the top panel. A ball bearing sits in it and plugs the bottom to keep it airtight, but the top has room for the bearing to slide sideways to get it precisely positioned. Added some lateral clearance for the stepper mounting holes, as well. Removed AB Stepper Modules from the XY Master and pulled it into the Master file because it mounts above the enclosure. BOM tweaks. 2022-02-22 Adjusted PN083/PN084 clearances around the extrusion. Tweaking master part list entries a bit, adding \"Supplies\" category that includes items of indeterminate quantity (e.g. lubricant) or that may be on hand as a tool (e.g. screwdrivers) and generally don't go on a BOM but will be needed. Removed old PN082 file. Rebalanced screws on the Z Gantries. There are now three M5 on top, three under. Finished insulation and fasteners for all of the panels but the flooring. Updated the master model and removed old paneling. Added in feet to the Outer Frame model. 2022-02-21 PN100 is finished. PTFE tube stays neatly out of the way and has a shorter feed path. Adding new milestones and issues to help sort short- and long-term goals. Turns out PN083 and PN084's issues are not thickness underneath the insert but severe ringing by the printer. Removed the issue. Will fix belt tension on printer later. Adding insulation and joints to the new panel models in the Outer Frame file. Finishing out the connector list based on the wire harnesses. 2022-02-20 Iterating through PN100 to get a satisfactory design. Nearly all internal connector wires have a prespecified length now. I will leave the undercarriage unspecified as it's short enough it can be left to the end user. Plus no two people are going to want to arrange it the same way. Not a lot of model progress today; focused on wiring. Now using a PTFE tube to stiffen the hotend wiring loom. No filament is in it--it just adds rigidity. 2022-02-19 Focusing on wiring today. Connectors.xlsx has a new tab for \"Upper Level Wiring\". This is wiring from the lower level patch panel up, e.g. to the hotend fans. Every connector has a pin count, recommended wire gauge, and approximate length needed. More will be filled in during disassembly. Added PN100, a PTFE tube guide to keep it from snagging the belts. The tube will now exit out of the back right, passing near the rear belts on the way. This will keep it out of the way and anchor it while the hotend moves. Top panel and hatch are modeled with a piano hinge. 2022-02-18 Added twin cutouts to the side panels. Right side cutout is for PTFE conduit, the left side is for exhaust. Still considering approachs to wiring for the hotend. 2022-02-17 One year since this all really started in earnest. Uploaded parametric t-slot extension for the electrical undercarriage, closing #14. Installed thermistor for the electronics ( TE ). Updated Connectors.xlsx to reflect minor changes. PN013, Tensioner Cap: fixed issue with impossible to print features. M5x25 instead of M5x16 screws are needed. They're already needed for the tensioner bolt iself, so no new fasteners are introduced. 2022-02-16 Raspberry Pi board mounts (PN083, PN084) are now horizontal to allow better airflow, fixing #15 Part numbers are now broken out into \"General Part List\" and \"Printed Part List\" All part numbers are now three digit. Created wire anchor assembly. Door frame assembly is modeled, minus the hinges. Concerned hinge gap is too small for door frame, or may leave too large a gap on the handle side. May need to design printable hinges to properly align. 2022-02-15 Fixed a ton of minor issues with brackets in the model. All brackets are now properly positioned and should be propogated. Removed brackets from the bed frame; will rely solely on printed parts. Bracket assemblies still used SHCS instead of button head; fixed and propagated. Filtration is in the model. Finished renaming printed part numbers. SP901E has a placeholder body with fasteners in the model, temporarily addressing #21. 2022-02-14 Fixed outer frame for part ID purposes. Added invisible SP901E assembly to the model to get it and the appropriate fasteners inventoried. Updated base foot and LED strips for part numbers. Too many minor changes to count. Lots of work on the prototype to reassemble the fixed skirt panels. 2022-02-13 Temporarily removed the part codes Markdown file, as it is not current. Too many changes are taking place with the BOM to keep up. Renamed Printer Part Codes.xlsx to Part Codes.xlsx and shifted it to the /BOM folder. Replaced stock nuts with anti-backlash in the model, fixed some missing screws in the Z Master Adjusted RPi panel mount connector profiles. The skirt is now fully modeled and should be correct in the BOM. Also tested and working. Made exhaust adapter fully parametric and exported to /CAD/Templates folder. Ditto LED Guide Channel. Exhaust adapter now has a larger fan exhaust duct coverage area to help keep it in place. Mass renamed filtration parts with appropriate names and updated Part Codes . Finalized Vertical Filter model. 2022-02-12 Exported parametric tools for heated inserts. Changed a few part categories and added a \"Type\" column for parts. Modified the 80mm fan grill for better printing. I believe all but some very odds-and-ends parts have numbers, so closing issue #20. 2022-02-11 Tensioner definitely needs rework. Removed PN100-PN103, the frame caps. With wood paneling, they are unnecessary. Pushing the ExtractBOM_PN Fusion script. Re-exporting files and continuing reprints before disassembly. Added a lot of entries that are not modeled, like heat shrink and zip ties. Most entries in the parts list now have links to reference suppliers New 80mm fan mounts for front and rear panels, with PNs 102 and 103 2022-02-10 Continuing fresh reprints. May have discovered an issue with the tensioner. Adding reference links to the BOM. Most parts are now in the BOM--looking to address issues like zip ties and other oddments Considering using placeholder (empty) bodies with part numbers to trigger the script when scraping for BOM. 2022-02-09 Moving through components to add part numbers and locate model inconsistencies. Resolved some very old model components that didn't get updated against the prototype. Printer Pard Codes.xlsx has a significant update with tabs for each BOM category. Fusion model now is largely updated with internal part codes for auto-generating a BOM. Python script for scraping part numbers and instances is initially done. Removed a lot of unused and outdated files from the Fusion project. Removed PN080 and PN081, the freestanding 80mm fan mount and grille, along with some other stale entries. Exported XY Pulleys and XY Joints again for final reprint before disassembly. 2022-02-08 Lots of progress auto-generating a BOM, though I will need to individually tag each part that needs to be included. Each part is tagged with a part number starting in \"PN\". These match up with the printed IDs, but are extended to any BOM part. This should massively speed up generating the BOM, as there are fewer parts added to the list (the script doesn't add anything without a \"PN\" part number). 2022-02-07 Visual display of chamber temperatures is critical, so I'm quickly adjusting the default display for Klipper. I also plan to change the menu layout, so I'm laying the groundwork for that, as well. Created a repository for Clock Face , as I'm calling the display screen. Removed the OctoPrint menu and changed \"SD Card\" to read \"Virtual SD\" It works and I've sketched up a new menu layout, so stopping on that for now. 2022-02-06 Updating issues. Going with a very simple, conservative, notched-edged panel approach for the floor. Working on auto-generating a BOM 2022-02-05 Closed #11 regarding air filtration, as a working vertical prototype is completed. Will proceed with 0.2\" plywood for panels due to cost. FPD of a new gantry lock bar. All project files now up to date with parametric heated insert holes. Enclosure maintaining at 45C with 48C target 2022-02-04 Enclosure maintains 3C above target at 45C. A 2/3 full 75mm tank is currently doing the job. Printed off two 50mm tanks. 2022-02-03 Working on testing Klipper, lights, and the exhaust in an enclosure. 2022-02-02 Modified exhaust adapter for ~20mm OD hose. Continuing to work on enclosure/Klipper/filtration integration Widened HEPA filter latch for vertical filter. Added a render of the finished filter assembly. Added pinout diagram for the SKR 2. 2022-01-25 - 2022-02-01 Focused at the moment on finding a plastics fabricator to answer some basic questions about material and panels. Meanwhile, since I can't enclose the prototype yet, I've setup Klipper on the ABS printer and am getting that ironed out. This way I can test the chamber exhaust in an real-world environment. Q1 2022 2022-01-24 Tested filtration with 75mm fans; much improved. Fit tested model with shroud--may need some minor adjustments to maintain tension around the HEPA filter. Current cold temperatures are making it diffiult to maintain chamber temps, so having more warp than usual and therefore more reprints. 2022-01-23 Tested the filtration; seems to work slowly but efficiently. Likely will rely on 75mm fan solution. Iterated through some changes to the base and fan intake for the vertical stand. Added a shroud to help keep the HEPA cartridge in place Modified the TPU latch to print on its back. Found two Raspberry Pis. 2022-01-22 Filtration Added a small hole to the center of the 75mm tank to add more perimeters for sturdiness. The center pillar is pretty weak. AC -> HEPA duct is done for the vertical filtration assembly. Testing dual 50mm fan setup in an enclosure today. GitHub Added a number of issues to GitHub and pinned an issue containing a list of what needs closing before disassembly. Removed Marlin firmware folder. It's not maintained or even finished, nor do I intend to move away from Klipper now. Reworded some of the readme.md and slimmed it down. Moved the TODO entirely to Issues. Moved orientation-specific STLs for filtration to subfolders. 2022-01-21 Clock 3 Renaming a lot of the components to group them by function. Added a new #95: a panel mount piece. A 50 pack of M5 heated inserts is $14 and will cover any panel subdivisions I need to make, as well as possibly being useful elsewhere. Filtration Made shims/TPU gaskets for both 75mm and 50mm fans. They push the fans out 1.6mm to make room for a hose adapter (and dampen noise). Both the 50mm and 75mm fan intakes work, though the right 50mm profile is incorrect. Working on 75mm fan exhaust to tighten fit. Modeling is difficult as there is some variation between brands in wall thicknesses, etc. Ordered 1\" ID hose instead of 1/4\". The 75mm fan is having difficulty providing pressure, so I'm going to try avoiding necking down. The 1/4\" hosing may still be useful for 50mm fans. 1/4\" hose is ideal for 50mm fan. 50mm fan intake is now front heavy with hose on, added hole for an insert and foot. Started work on a fully vertical filter tower. 2022-01-20 Will need TPU shims to leave room for tubing connectors. Fixed fan holes to fit regardless of orientation. Added foot to 75mm fan intake. Added small front foot to use with 75mm fan intake Modeled 75mm radial fan 2022-01-19 Dual 50mm seem like they would work for a small chamber, particularly with one 50mm running continuously as exhaust. Modeled and started a FPD for dual 75mm blowers. Looking into flexible hosing, ordered 1/4\" ID, 1/2\" OD silicone tubing and push connectors. Dual 75mm is front-heavy. 2022-01-18 Created a hole diameter test for heat pressing with variable tapers. Big change in standard heated inserts after testing. All inserts (both vertically and horizontally) will default to 4.5mm with a -4 degree taper. Re-exported all affected STL files. Created heated_insert_test_block.md in the /Docs folder to explain heated insert testing. Air filter prototype is finished; waiting on new fans to test. 2022-01-17 Filtration: Finished the latch, hinge, and carbon tank gasket. Added in all fasteners to the filtration model. Started printing FPD of components. Added renders to GitHub. Hinges work, latches align. Remodeled backside of activated carbon duct to reduce weight by 50 grams, down from over 200 (2mm perimeters, 20% infill). Generic ABS not happy with such a large solid volume (delaminating). Printing in PETG for now, will switch to modified ABS later. 2022-01-16 Took a break yesterday; came up with some good ideas. ~~Working on a relatively straightforward, 3-fan filtration setup, but need to dissect a fan first to get the diameter of the inner bearings.~~ Destroyed a fan; starting over. Almost done with a different setup using just two 5015 or 7530 fans. 2022-01-15 Activated carbon appears to be a good supplier. No sign of rust on any of the test items. Updated the FAQ a bit. 2022-01-14 Waiting on HEPA filters so working on polishing XY components for milestone print. Added surface chamfers to XY Pulleys, XY Joint components. Fixed #1 and #2 ID text to specify that they are Left side components. Redid #8, R Top XY Joint. Center rib now stretches to the wire anchor, the anchor is slightly deeper, and there is now a lip around the rear edge. Found a screw hole that somehow got lost on #10. 2022-01-13 Had some initial success using a French press filter to hold the activated carbon. Testing a lid with another French press filter to act as a sealed container for activated carbon. AC will either need to be pre-sieved or thoroughly shaken in the container to sieve the finer particles out. Last export of bed corner bracket didn't have part code. This is fixed. Modest edits to the readme. 2022-01-12 Working on some concepts for filtration. 2022-01-11 Fixed mounting hole size for part cooling fan. Created a skeleton FAQ. Added a note in the /Firmware/Klipper folder where to find the .cfg files for Klipper. Testing virgin coconut shell activated carbon for oxidation. Hopefully this is a good supplier. Raised A/B steppers a few mm. Now use M5x45mm screws. Lots of issues resolved on the X Gantry and hotend. Changed mointing direction for part cooling fan. Heated insert no longer enters at an angle, which should help alignment issues. BLTouch mount works. Pretty much every component touched to update Parameters file. No changes due to new parameters yet. Went through a number of iterations on the camera mount. Have settled on a location near the front left on top of the tensioner. Steadily adding issues to the issue tracker. Working on setting some initial milestones. 2022-01-10 Hotend now locks in place with two screws into the mount itself, rather than passing through to the front plate. This allows preassembly of the hotend and fewer screws to remove the mount plate for belt access (4->2). Between the above and changing the fan screws, the hotend cage, fan and all, can be removed with 4 total screws instead of 8. Fixed an issue with the front mount plate's vent not passing all the way through. Steadily adding 0.4mm chamfers to narrow holes (mostly screw holes) that touch the build surface in case of elephant's foot. Completed hotend and stepper mount modification so far. Also moving ID # off the build surface if an alternate location is available, e.g. under the stepper on the BMG mount. This keeps the # from fusing closed. Added Octopus pinout diagram to docs. Belt clamps now have a 'U' shape with much more grip. Display works on prototype now. Note: Klipper docs use a reversed orientation for their board aliases from Marlin, so I skipped using aliases and directly inserted pins. 2022-01-09 Created a Klipper config repository. Working on an Raspberry Pi camera mount. 2022-01-08 Added #110 (a different #110), which is a panel mount for an SD card extension PCB. Crack the extension case, slip the cable through the back and the PCB into the slot. Mounts with 2 brass inserts. Finished prototype wiring, labeling, and front panel. Now working on Klipper. Need to flip RPi mount to lay flat for cooling. Started adding issues to Github. Working on initial Klipper config. 2022-01-07 Printing was delayed by layer shifting on the 92mm fan mount. Did a relayout on the left panel mount. The Fusion timeline is more manageable and the layout of the connectors more logical. Front panel mounts all fit save for Ethernet and SD Card--expect those to arrive today. Added zip tie anchors to the forward-facing side of the panel mount. RJ-45 cutout is off by a bit, but it fit after some effort. Going on the TODO list. 2022-01-06 More wire anchors, more wire routing. Finishing front panel component printing. Added through hole for a screw to the display slot so that the front panel will have two vertical fasteners. Added a cutout for full size SD card slot with the rest of the panel mounts in front. Waiting on extension PCB to arrive in the mail, so no corresponding mount yet. Moved USB, HDMI, and Ethernet panel mounts to left panel to avoid crowding the display area. Modified left interior panel mount for chamber thermistor and chamber fan ports. Shortened and recrimped much of the undercarriage. Feeling more comfortable with the general state and layout of the undercarriage wiring. Shortened tops of wiring panel mounts to leave space for flooring panel to inset. 2022-01-05 Working on wiring in general: Raspberry Pi now has a dedicated power/IO cable that I've hot-glued in place. I can't figure another way to properly secure Dupont connectors, as they don't latch. Hot glue it is. Created a harness to properly wire the SP901E and mounted it. Checked light wiring connections and recrimped a few. Added wire anchors in numerous locations. 2022-01-04 Added JST SM connectors for the alpha and beta steppers. They now plug in to the back skirt end panels instead of being wired to the board directly. This modified #106 and #107. Designed skirt slot for display and USB, HDMI, and Ethernet ports. Started initial Raspberry Pi and Klipper setup. Reorganized fan headers, added Supply Voltage column to Connectors.xlsx . Finished the back skirt assembly, including today's modifications. 2022-01-03 Added tab with a screw hole for the skirt grille. It's a little flimsy in the center currently. Modified power switch port to accept 15mm hex nut cutout. Should stabilize the power switch. Skirt ends: moved M5 hole down to give easier access with plugs and switches and such installed. 2022-01-02 Tweaked frame caps so the screw holes are more printable Re-exported X gantry's front plate. 2022-01-01 Back in office. 31 parts to print until I'm caught up. Strengthened PSU bracket Switched to M4 screws for PSU bracket (oops) Modified fan exhaust and intakes to print properly. Fan mount had impossible overhangs; this is fixed. Tweaked tolerance for IEC plug Q4 2021 2021-12-30 Added some bracing to the electrical panel mounts to reduce flex and moved them further back. Introduced the wiring panels to the master model. Added lighting into the model for 3 x 12 pixel strips at 60px/m (16.6mm spacing). Made a few fixes to the lighting strip so the zip tie does not cross over an LED. Plenty of new renders. 2021-12-29 Fixed ABL mount issues with belt attachment screws. Also simplified mounting the hotend fan. Two screws mount into the fan shroud and two pass through to mount both. The fan shroud and fan then can come off with two screws instead of four. Added motion joints. Reviewed assemblies and added any missing fasteners. Updated wiring anchors on the x gantry. BMG mount now has a groove and zip tie channels for wiring on the right side. Electrical T Slot Extension now has a slot for inserting new roll-in tee nuts (or taking them out) without having to dismount the extrusion. 2021-12-28 Fairly significant number of changes today. Added a number of missing brackets in the model. I believe they are all present now, but will check WBIO (when back in office). Fixed a few naming issues in the part codes list. Working on consistency and logical grouping. Re-numbering will come WBIO. Iterating through the models and making sure all fasteners are present. Added a TPU vibration damper between the AB stepper mounts and the frame. I will test TPU washers WBIO. Fixed minor issues with tensioner assembly/disassembly. Inset M3s on the tensioner top and added chamfers for screw head insertion/removal. Removed #97 after integrating wire guide into the right top XY Joint piece (#8). Entire XY axis assembly has fasteners but the hotend and X gantry. Z axis now has all fasteners; fixed Z2 stepper mislocation. Deleted #95 Wire Guide part ID entry, as the anchors are doing just fine. Trying to modify the side panels for the new crossbars but running into Fusion issues. 2021-12-27 Finished rear exhaust and tagging pieces with IDs for the skirt. Publishing 104-111 and reserving 112 and 113 for the display (to be done when back in office). Fixed up the electronics undercarriage file with parts already designed. Added PSU to the model and desgined a power supply mount, as well. 2021-12-26 Significant work done on skirts: Designed frame and section system. Front panels are modular and replaceable but fit together with screws. Finished 92mm fan intake, right switch panel, two identical center grille pieces. Work for screen and front communications ports can be done once back in office. Rear panel has two grilles and two fan cutouts, plus an IEC panel mount spot. Not entirely satisfied with fan cutouts, will work on them in the morning and push everything tomorrow. Added #s 100-103, the caps to cover the exterior frame edges at the base and top. 2021-12-23 I needed to bring a buck converter with me, so added #85 for a 5A DROK mount. 2021-12-22 Preparing for vacation, so slowing activity. Significantly cleaned up wiring in undercarriage area. Added Marlin firmware modifications to source tree. Eventually switching to Klipper, but this is functional. Slight modification to the SKR2 board mount to improve clearance beneath. Created a Raspberry Pi board mount. 2021-12-21 IT PRINTS. Working on firmware for lighting. May need to open an issue with Marlin or push a fix to get two light strips synced with different controllers. First controller (BTT 12864 display) follows the lighting pattern, the second is static. Testing a patch to printer_event_leds.h and printer_event_leds.cpp . It requires adding another preprocessor flag, but it seems to work. Printing at 120mm/s and 0.16mm layers okay. Blower needs a higher minimum cutoff. Reintroduced Y axis frame bracing to reduce frame vibration during Y axis moves. Modified light channel to have deeper siding. 2021-12-20 Finished all crimps but ABL. Started mapping headers and began Wiki with corresponding article. Tested limit switches, fans, thermistors, bed heat, and finally first hotend heat and filament extrusion. Designed mount for programmable LEDs. Design is parametric based on spacing, PCB width, and LED count. Includes a zip tie anchor. LED tests. SP901E is finicky with WS2815, leaving it out for now. Nearly all connectors are now labeled. Resolved display issue. Added a modification of an old PTFE tubing coupler design. This part should go away in later revisions. First print should be tomorrow. 2021-12-19 Recrimped (properly) all but three of the JST SM connections. Generic crimper for the XH and PH connectors arrived, so went ahead and finished the connectors for all three harnesses above the electrical undercarriage. Created an 80mm fan mount for cooling the steppers. Will upload after verifying the second print fits. Mounted the Octopus. Started work on skirt layout, including IEC (power in) and power switch location. Crimped even more wires. 2021-12-18 Fixed emboss on right patch panel Revision 2 of XY Joint wire guide. Dealing with some elephant's foot. Added a file for extending spare T slot underneath for mounting equipment. The file is parametric for the end-user's modification. Designed clamps for board mounting Added screw holes to board tray to secure it in place. Modified blank tray template and exported STEP file to /CAD folder. Rebuilt Octopus tray from template file. Threw out the last four entries about clamps and boards and went with a simpler design with fewer parts and easier mounting. Boards mount at an angle for easier access from the front. Made parts for both Octopus and SKR 2 (1.4 if you can find it anymore) Started plotting out Octopus fan header usage (cleaner and simpler for now than using SKR 2 + bucks) 2021-12-17 Fixed issue with patch panels. Terminated wires, probably terribly, but at least have the lengths and wrap done. Will re-crimp properly later (before using the wires). Finished up the T Slot Wire Anchor design. Tested panel mount--will need to be moved backwards. Added a wire guide for the right XY Joint to keep the harness elevated. Redesigned wire panel mounts to sit further back, leaving more room for exiting wire. Added a folder for test GCODE and a basic movement test file, though it needs...testing. Modified Z limit switches to lower them 6mm. Discovered issue with BLTouch mount after attaching cable ties. Will probably try and move mount position forward a few mm. 2021-12-16 Finished labeling wiring panels. Documented part names for consistency and added info to the Readme. All parts with wires now have 2-3 letter codes for commonality of labels on connectors and panels. Designed panels for left and right side to connect wiring. Created Electronics Master file for undercarriage area. Working on wire anchors/guide channels Will start testing lighting channels at some point soon. Crimped way, way more wires today. Probably done crimping until the JST-PH connectors arrive. 2021-12-15 Tested XY motion Designed and tested replacement for Z bottom bracket that includes rail alignment. Tested all endstops Added build plate Sketched up panel mounts for JST-SM connectors for 2-6 pins and fit-tested Began setting up wiring for JST-SM Added STL Filename column to Part Codes Crimped a lot of wires. Created file for tracking wire codes and terminal names 2021-12-14 Fixed some issues with the left pulley component. Fixed an incorrect peg hole depth on right mid XY Joint . Added 5mm to the AB stepper mounts. Pushed Y limit switch out ~20mm to allow clearance for the X limit switch. This is hacky, but will work and keep the bed area available. Adjusted screw holes on right pulley component to account for the new limit switch mount. Designed Bowden mount for BMG. Designed Gantry Lock for servicing hotend and belts. Raised the Y limit switch a bit to give clearance for heated inserts in the mount. 2021-12-13 Fixed up some Tony Table issues Created a Y rail alignment guide for in front of the tensioners Right XY Joint now has attachment points for zip ties and a guide for wiring. Right XY Joint now has additional room (1mm) for cut tolerance on the X axis extrusions/linear rail and heat growth for both the same. Adjusted height of XY pulley components to allow for 0.2mm difference in height of the milled Y rail. Fixed some issues with the Left XY Joint 's bottom piece. All XY Joint belt guides are now at roofed at 35 degree angles instead of the prior 45 degrees. This shouldn't be an issue with print difficulty and will give additional belt clearance. Ditto Stepper Pulleys . Added Y Axis Rail Guide parts for both sides on the Stepper Pulleys components. The Y limit switch mounts on this guide . Spent part of the day learning to crimp JST-SM pins and replacing Blender's heater cartridge (terminated in JST-SM, but also what Clock 3 uses) Added X Limit Switch Mount Published to a public repository. Dropped the fan duct about a millimeter to get it to blow under the nozzle (hopefully). 2021-12-12 FPD and second iteration for part cooling duct. The front half is from the EVA project, modified for heated inserts. Redid all gantry core fastener locations to make room for other parts. Working belt clamp design. Created a Tony Table with part codes. 2021-12-11 Assembled second X gantry print--much better clearances around the hotend and fit is good. PTFE collar issue resolved with a brace on the mounting bracket Added fourth screw hole to extruder mount and relocated to ensure flat connection. Added zip tie anchors on front mount plate for wiring. Started work on belt tie-offs. Updated part color-coding and ran into some Fusion bugs. 2021-12-10 Installed bed frame of correct length. Bed is now a complete unit and finished. Installed new lead screws (500mm). X axis extrusion and Z crossbar should both arrive today for proper kinematics testing. Still having 12864 display issues. Modified the hotend mounting bracket to have an install point for ABL. Created a BLTouch bracket (what I have on hand). There is now a working mount for the BMG + stepper of arbitrary depth. Included cutouts for mounting with wires sideways. Frame is now current to spec . 2021-12-09 Testing bed height adjustment screw with a locking thumbscrew, similar to the Ender 5's Z endstop trigger. Working in earnest on hotend mount and cooling. FPD for V6/BMG mount. Testing PTFE Collar to allow PTFE tube from extruder to be removable and reattachable easily. Started work on paneling. Added a few missing joints. Added clearance to edges of X axis by rounding the XY Joint fronts. 2021-12-08 Tested new limit switch arrangement to raise bed. Adjusted limit switch design. Reassembled XY Joint . Some adjustments to Z Gantry and Lead Screw Plates . More limit switch design tweaks to maximize volume. Finished bed wire support design. Added linear rail stop to raise maximum bed height with identical build volume. Working towards shortening filament path for hotend when the X Gantry comes together. Need to stiffen up new limit switch, but that can wait. Pursuing modular panel cutouts for flooring to simplify design and add flexibility for later. Modeled full exterior frame and brackets Combined frame and internal parts into Master file Lots of additions to Parameters file and fixes 2021-12-07 Organized files, now tracking STLs with a naming scheme in a spreadsheet Fixed misnumbered and nonsequential parts Lots of work to fix endstop issue and raise Z bed max Several iterations to fix small issues with the XY Joint (no longer XY Interface) Actively working towards a hotend arrangement design Switched to button head screws for most printed parts on the test rig Designed cable support piece for the bed wires 2021-12-06 Worked around X axis linear rail Adjusted XY interface for linear rail on bottom Modeled X gantry and hotend Tested cooler ideas, explored EVA as a COTS option (belts incompatible) 2021-12-05 Worked on Z axis all day Z limit switch designed, printed, and tested Fixed issues with Z steppers after too much troubleshooting Added several files for components Making switch to button head screws to avoid recesses to socket head.

Sigh. Completed FPD of right side for XY interface, refined left. Calculated first two frame cuts, started labeling frame for machining Stole X linear rail for Z axis. Will order a higher quality one for the X. Adapted Clock 2 limit switch plate for Y axis and made a template for the other axes. Ordered Clock 2 -> Snow Angel frame pieces FPD for tensioner (they mirror, so only one design) Added belt guide channel for right y gantry Continued to refine tensioner Added rail stops to X axis, built into the XY interface top pieces. Prelimary Z work Most of the design done for AB stepper mounts and internal bearing to help align the drive rods. 2021-11-30 Cleaned up stepper pulley plates after assembly XY Interface design started Completed first printable design (FPD) for left side of XY interface (where X extrusion mates with the Y linear rail carriage) 2021-11-29 Created XY Master file Swapped in braces with center threads Fit tested stepper pulley plates 2021-11-28 Lots of work on the rear idlers and stepper pulleys Disassembled most of test printer Pieces will now be numbered and have a L or R designation where applicable. 2021-11-27 Created a clock-3 branch and started organizing files Expanded layout file Finished full belt path in layout file and added offset planes for frame and belts Still determining exact belt Z offset, as much of the design depends on that 2021-11-26 Created a layout file for inserting derived parametrics and sketches Started breaking out parameters Sketched 3-point Z layout Did a quick pass at designing the stepper pulley bodies to look for issues in the layout file Created a hole diameter test block and brass insert practice block, inaugurating the Tools folder. ~2021-11-25 Picked it back up again. Time for a redesign. Planning 3 point Z, smaller, tighter enclosure Switched to F695 idlers from F688 to save ~1/4\" of width and depth. Working on a switch to brass inserts now that I have a press for them. Break Life got involved. Q3 2021 2021-08-19 Back to printing Linear Bearing Mounts. Planning to install wiring harness in center-rear. Fit tested new limit switches (Ender 3-style). 2021-08-15 Printed and assembled simple PETG hotend mounting plate. The entire gantry cart for the hotend is now in finished PETG except the backside belt attachment component. Proceeding with Mini Fit Jr connectors for (nearly) everything. Installed heatsinks on alpha and beta steppers 2021-08-12 - 2021-08-14 Resolved print issues Currently one Linear Bearing Mount printed, waiting on filament. Printed second Z endstop and updated firmware configuration. 2021-08-11 Reprint of two Linear Bearing Mounts Test print for a corner bracket cover Reworked hotend carriage's belt fastening a bit. Added guide channels around the backside for working blind to center the belt. 2021-08-10 Installed insulating washers. Installed finished feet. Installed new 204020 extrusion for above door. The hole for the linear bearing has too little clearance with my current print settings. Doing tests to find a balance. 2021-08-09 Worked on aligning Z axis components Continued printing PETG bed parts Printed TPU feet Designed insulating washer for between the underside of the bed and the hex nuts 2021-08-08 Started assembling and mounting print bed & frame Glued heatsinks on to alpha and beta steppers Attached PETG endstops Testing PETG Z limit switch mount More minor PETG parts Designed bracket cover 2021-08-07 First Tr8 nut mount print Designed Linear Bearing Assembly Designed Bed Mount Alignment Spacer to properly center and align bed. Added limit switch bumper to nut mount Added Z limit switch mount New Alignment Spacers for Z Axis assembly. Minor appearance fixes. Continued refining bed components. 2021-08-06 Restarted Z axis work Got Tr8 nut mount nearly designed Fixed up component tree, added Internal Assembly Assembled bed & swapped in more threaded brackets 2021-08-05 Got to a good place on the hotend/belt mount components Designed the X Axis Limit Switch Bumper and Endstop (I need a shorter name for this) Attached the hotends on a simple mount. There's no way to raise or lower them (nor a print bed yet) but it gives me a moving test object. Working on hotend wire management and clamping belts. 2021-08-04 Continued redesinging hotend/belt mount Integrated hotend to X gantry Replaced X rail stops with Y axis rail stops, need to redesign x limit switch bumper. Reorganized a lot of files. TPU printed files are now color coded a teal color. Started an Internal Assembly file integrating frame and components. 2021-08-03 Printed final tensioners Fought with Fusion Redesigned hotend mount Redid Frame model from scratch. Modeled off-brand BCZAMD version of Bondtech's BMG ALU mount. 2021-08-02 Finished reassembling both Y gantry carts and got the X gantry extrusion on. Iterated on tensioner design Printed stepper caps 2021-08-01 Assembling X gantry at new height Designed new tensioners through several iterations. The new design is much narrower and sleeker. Also uses a shorter screw. Stepper alignment caps need redesign Inserted super thick brackets to the frame. Minor fixes. 2021-07-31 Reassembling piece by piece to check for issues and square frame. Need to reassemble again to inset more spring-loaded t nuts and to record for instructions. Alignment shims now slide in to the extrusion or some other guide to prevent slippage. Moved X axis extrusion up 4mm to simplify logistics for screws and raise the nozzle. Redid floor of Y gantry carts for PETG printing 2021-07-30 Finished frame brackets and fasteners, needs review Started printing parts in PETG. 80mm alignment spacer for base alignment added Added more pre-assembled fasteners with screws and tee nuts Disassembled test frame for reassembly to new specs 2021-07-29 Designed Y endstop switch mount Lots of small polishing Added alignment piece for the stepper mounts Preformatted brackets added Alignment spacer for the Y axis crossbars added Completed frame, working on inserting all brackets and fasteners 2021-07-28 Endstop switch work 2021-07-27 Second pass at back piece, adjusted hole sizes for standoffs Initial X endstop design. Wrong way; flipped to home to the right. Mounted hotend gantry test. 2021-07-26 Fusion is crashing again/still. Started hotend gantry design Assembles in three main pieces, finished the MGN12H carriage section in the middle. First pass at back piece for belt mounting. 2021-07-25 Finished up V1 of the bed, still needs polish Now have a mount for leadscrews. Redesigning the jigs for the Z axis to be slightly narrower. 2021-07-24 Started designing bed Got initial size in place, 510mm x 260mm for frame, re-using Z axis struts that are going to be widened. 2021-07-23 Z Axis needs to be setup first or it's going to be difficult. Strugged with Z axis all day. 2021-07-22 Fusion crapped itself. Again. Looking in to endstop positioning. Will home to the front-right, so considering that aspect. Designed jig for Z axis Steppers will all have 2mm or 3mm thick covers on the their mounting plates to hold the 35 metal spacers in place and add additional spacing for the 45mm screws. 35mm spacer + 3mm plate + 3mm printed spacer = 41mm, leaving 4mm to screw in to the stepperi 2021-07-21 Printed and finished linear rail stops Adjusted height of tensioners (off by 5mm) Tested XY kinematics Started design of Z axis 2021-07-20 Assembled full belt system Designed gantry lock for servicing belts and hotend Designed end stops for X and Y axis linear rails 2021-07-19 Worked on belt system Printed various tensioner iterations Assembled working right tensioner and installed one belt. Adjusted wall thicknesses & offsets for tensioner. Fixed a few issues and tested a lot of bad ideas. Tensioner now acts as endstop for Y axis linear rails on the front side. 2021-07-18 Moved out extrusions in the X axis. Ideally will resolve spacing and alignment with shorter X axis rail or 60mm wide front extrusions connecting the interior and exterior frames. Tweaked and assembled right Y gantry. Moved Y axis rails backwards to add more room for hotend. 2021-07-17 Finished stepper pulley/rear idlers component. Assembled stepper pulley/idler blocks. Continued work on Y gantry. Finished printing Mk2 of the Y gantry. No major snags. Mk1 belt tensioner designed Began tensioner printing","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"status/changelog/#q2-2022","text":"","title":"Q2 2022"},{"location":"status/changelog/#2022-06-06","text":"Tweaked latch designs somewhat for cleaner appearance and open/close action (PN129-PN131).

The file needed is M3 Het Set Insert Parameter Block.stl file in the /STL/Tools subdirectory. Hole Sizes Below are the sizes and taper angles of each position on the test block.

Press the inserts (preferably with a insert press) and note the characteristics: How readily the insert drops in: is there resistance? Does it seems to just fall right in without grabbing the plastic? There should be some resistance, but too much will cause plastic to bubble up inside the threads. The resulting plastic around the insert: does it raise at all above the insert? Is there a clear gap around the knurls? Is there a smooth transition between the plastic around the knurls and the untouched plastic? You're looking for the last of the three. The bottom of the insert: is it smooth? Did any plastic seep up from underneath? Too high signals your insert is not fully seated. Too low is caused by plastic coming up underneath the insert. Using the following three checks, move down and to the right, noting which insert \"feels\" right in each row (not too much pressure, not too little). If a taper of doesn't work for one row, don't re-use it for the next row. Keep moving down and to the right. Your finished product should look something like this picture . Note that an insert was plucked out (with tweezers!) before being fully inserted. If you feel too much resistance with insertion or generally feel it's the wrong size, it probably is the wrong size. Carefully look over the inserts and check depths with calipers. You're looking for the correct depth (5.8mm) and a smooth surface. In the picture, the ideal size wound up being 4.5 with a taper of -4 degrees (third row, third column). Updating the Fusion Model The Parameters file will need to be updated. M3_insert_dia and M3_insert_taper are the respective parameters to set. From there you will need to update and export the STL files.","title":"Heated Insert Parameter Testing Tool"},{"location":"tools/heated_insert_test_block/#heated-insert-parameter-testing-tool","text":"","title":"Heated Insert Parameter Testing Tool"},{"location":"tools/heated_insert_test_block/#what-to-print","text":"You will need to do the test process twice, once printed flat and once vertically.
