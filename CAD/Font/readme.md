# Hack, a Font Face

This project uses [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/#download) as a general-purpose, easily printable, monospace font. You'll need to download it to open the source model in Fusion 360.

There's a [download page](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/#download) or you can grab them from this Git source folder.

It's also a great font face for coding or scripting if you need a new one.

Hack is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/blob/master/LICENSE.md). A copy is in this folder, as well.
