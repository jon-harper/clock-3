# Firmware for Clock 3

Clock 3 runs on Klipper. Marlin and/or RepRapFirmware *might* be able to run the printer, but a lot of features would be missing, such as the camera.

## Klipper Config Files

You can find the `.cfg` files in the [clock3-klipper](../../../../clock3-klipper) repository. It's a separate repository so that it can be cloned directly into a subdirectory of your `~/klipper_config` directory.

## Macros?

As I build up a collection of Klipper macros, I will create an additional repository for general Klipper macros. Any Clock 3-specific macros will likely be part of the [clock3-klipper](../../../../clock3-klipper) repository.
